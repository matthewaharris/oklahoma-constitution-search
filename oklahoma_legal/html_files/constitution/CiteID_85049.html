<P>§ 9B. Technology center school districts for technology center schools - Tax levies.<BR></P><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>A. Technology center school districts for technology center schools may be established and a levy of not to exceed five (5) mills on the dollar valuation of the taxable property in any technology center school district so established may be made annually, for the district, when the levy is approved by a majority of the electors of the technology center school district, voting on the question at an election called for that purpose. The levy shall be in addition to all other levies authorized by this Constitution, and when approved, shall be made each fiscal year thereafter until repealed by a majority of the electors of the technology center school district, voting on the question at an election called for that purpose. </P>
<P>B. Any technology center school district so established shall be considered as a school district for the purposes of Sections 10 and 26 of this Article. The administrative control and direction of the technology center school district shall be vested in a school board which shall be constituted and empowered as provided for by law for school boards of independent school districts. </P>
<P>C. Provisions of other subsections of this section notwithstanding, in any case where a college technology center school district recognized pursuant to Section 4423 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and established by vote of the people after December 31, 1968, overlaps and includes territory which is included within the district of a technology center school established as prescribed by the State Board of Career and Technology Education pursuant to Section 14-108 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, except as otherwise provided in this section, only the levies made by the college technology center school district shall be applied to the overlap territory. Incentive levies may be applied to the overlap area by either the college technology center school district or technology center school district and revenues from the overlap area collected pursuant to any incentive levy so made shall be apportioned one-half (1/2) to the college technology center school district making the levy and one-half (1/2) to the overlapped technology center school district. Only one district shall make an incentive levy in the overlap territory during any given time period. In any case where a college technology center school district recognized pursuant to Section 4420 or 4420.1 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes overlaps and includes territory which is included within the district of a technology center school established as prescribed by the State Board of Career and Technology Education pursuant to Section 14-108 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, said overlap territory shall be subject to all levies of both kinds of districts that are approved by a majority of the electors.</P>
<P>D. Provisions of other subsections of this section notwithstanding, in any case where a college technology center school district recognized pursuant to Section 4423 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and established by vote of the people after December 31, 1968, but before July 1, 2012, overlaps and includes territory which is included within the district of a technology center school established as prescribed by the State Board of Career and Technology Education pursuant to Section 14-108 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, except as otherwise provided in this section, the building fund levy made pursuant to Section 10 of this Article may be applied to the overlap area by either the college technology center school district or technology center school district and revenues from the overlap area collected pursuant to any building fund levy so made shall be apportioned one-half (1/2) to the college technology center school district making the levy and one-half (1/2) to the overlapped technology center school district. Only one district shall make a building fund levy in the overlap territory during any given time period.</P><STRIKE>
<P></STRIKE>E. In addition to any other levies authorized by this section, a technology center school district may make a local incentive levy for the benefit of the technology center school district in an amount not to exceed five (5) mills on the dollar valuation of the taxable property in the technology center school district when approved by a majority of those registered voters of the technology center school district voting on the question at an election called for that purpose. Except as otherwise provided, this levy, when approved, shall be made each fiscal year thereafter until repealed by a majority of the electors of the technology center school district voting on the question at an election called for that purpose. A technology center school district which has previously failed to approve a local incentive levy at two consecutive elections held between January 1, 1994, and May 31, 1994, may make a local incentive levy for the benefit of the technology center school district only if approved by a majority of the registered voters of the technology center school district voting on the question at an election for each fiscal year. If a majority of voters approve the local incentive levy for three (3) consecutive years, the levy approved on the third year shall be made each fiscal year thereafter until repealed by a majority of the electors of the technology center school district voting on the question at an election called for that purpose.</P><STRIKE>
<P></STRIKE>F. Upon the establishment of technology center school districts, the districts are authorized to become indebted separate and apart from the indebtedness of any school district included in the technology center school district up to five percent (5%) of the net valuation of taxable property within the technology center school district for capital improvements, including purchasing sites and constructing, purchasing, improving, and equipping real property and buildings when the indebtedness is approved by a majority of the electors of the technology center school district voting on the question in an election called for that purpose.</P><STRIKE>
<P></STRIKE>G. Until otherwise provided for by law, technology center school districts and the government of technology center school districts shall be established in accordance with criteria and procedures prescribed by the State Board of Career and Technology Education.</P><STRIKE>
<P></STRIKE>H. The Legislature may alter, amend, delete, or add to the provisions of this section by law.</P>
