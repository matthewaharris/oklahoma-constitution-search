<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT 
size=2>
<P>A. The board of education of each school district shall use the following 
system of initiating, recording and paying for all purchases, salaries, wages or 
contractual obligations due from any of the funds under the control of such 
board of education. However, a school district board of education may use the 
procedures outlined in <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=88221">Section 304.1 
of Title 62</A> of the Oklahoma Statutes for the payment of salaries and wages 
only if the board so votes. The provisions contained herein shall not apply to 
the sinking fund and school activity fund.</P>
<P>B. The encumbrance clerk and treasurer of the school district shall each 
enter the authorized amounts in the various appropriation accounts of the funds 
to which this system is applied. The authorized amounts of appropriations shall 
be the general fund and building fund appropriations approved by the county 
excise board and such additional amounts as may be applied in the manner 
provided by law, the amount received for deposit in a special cash fund where 
such special cash fund is authorized by law or required by the person or agency 
providing such funds, or the amount of the net proceeds realized from the sale 
of bonds of the school district and any other income due such fund.</P>
<P>C. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the board of education of the 
school district to prescribe and administer adequate business procedures and 
controls governing the purchase or confirmation of purchase and delivery of 
goods or services. The procedures shall include delivery of an acceptable 
invoice by document, facsimile, electronic or other standard form that includes 
the information required by the district. Such procedures shall include the 
designation of authorized persons to purchase goods or services for the district 
and the method of determining the school employee receiving delivery of each 
purchase.</P>
<P>D. Prior to the issuance of a purchase order, the encumbrance clerk must 
first determine that the encumbrance will not exceed the balance of the 
appropriation to be charged. The encumbrance clerk shall charge the appropriate 
appropriation accounts and credit the affected encumbrances outstanding accounts 
with the encumbrances. Encumbrances must be submitted to the board of education 
in the order of their issuance on a monthly basis, subject to a monthly business 
cycle cut-off date determined by the board of education. Approved encumbrances 
shall be listed in the minutes by the minute clerk.</P>
<P>E. Before any purchase is completed, a purchase order or encumbrance must be 
issued. No bill shall be paid unless it is supported by an itemized invoice 
clearly describing the items purchased, the quantity of each item, its unit 
price, its total cost and proof of receipt of such goods or services. The bill 
and/or invoice shall be filed in the encumbrance clerk's official records. If a 
district has the ability to electronically utilize evaluated receipt settlement 
(ERS), the district may remit to vendors on that basis if the requirements of 
this subsection are fulfilled. In the event a district is establishing 
electronic data interchange, electronic entries will suffice in lieu of paper 
documents. In order for a district to be authorized to utilize an evaluated 
receipt settlement system:</P>
<P>1. The ERS must result in payment by the district from vendor receipts that 
have been matched to the purchase order date;</P>
<P>2. The ERS may only be used when there is an agreement between the district 
and the vendor for use of an ERS; and</P>
<P>3. The ERS must be included in the district's journal ledger/accounts 
payable/purchase order software.</P>
<P>F. The encumbrance clerk shall debit the encumbrances outstanding account and 
credit the accounts payable account for the amount of the approved bill. The 
board of education shall determine the extent such costs may fluctuate without 
additional board action. Minor adjustments not requiring additional board 
approval shall be referenced to the original encumbrance.</P>
<P>G. An approved bill may be paid by issuing a warrant or check against the 
designated fund only after ascertaining that proper accounting of the purchase 
has been made and that the files contain the required information to justify the 
expenditure of public funds, except as otherwise provided in subsection I of 
this section. The warrants or checks so issued shall be recorded in an orderly 
numerical system established by the district. The encumbrance clerk shall charge 
the warrant or checks against the accounts payable account and credit it to the 
warrants or checks issued account. Provided, if payment is to be made 
immediately and the board of education deems it advisable, the postings to the 
accounts payable account may be omitted and the payment of the approved bill may 
be credited directly to the warrants or checks issued account. The warrant or 
check shall show on its face the name of the school district, the date of issue, 
the payee, the amount, the expenditure classification code, and such other 
information as may be necessary or desirable. The president and clerk of the 
board of education shall each sign the warrant or check, or approved facsimile 
thereby denoting to the public that the warrant or check is for the purpose and 
within the amount of the appropriation charged.</P>
<P>H. The treasurer shall register the warrant or check in the warrant or check 
register, charging the appropriation account and crediting the warrants or 
checks outstanding account of the designated fund. Provided, no warrant or check 
shall be registered in excess of the appropriation account's balance. All 
warrants or checks shall be registered in the order of their issuance. Voided 
warrants or checks shall be registered and filed with the treasurer. The 
treasurer shall sign each warrant or check through individual signature or 
approved facsimile showing its registration date and shall state whether it is 
payable or nonpayable. When a warrant or check is paid, the treasurer shall 
maintain evidence the warrant or check has been processed and paid. Nothing in 
this subsection shall prohibit any governing board from using automated 
recordkeeping procedures, provided the information required in this subsection 
can be accessed.</P>
<P>I. Any board of education of a school district of this state may make a 
payment which would otherwise be made by warrant or check, by disbursement 
through an Automated Clearing House, bank account debit system, wire transfer 
through the Federal Reserve System, or any other automated payment system 
operated by a financial institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. The internal controls over such payment system shall be reviewed 
and approved by the independent auditor of the district during the annual audit. 
The provisions of Sections <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=88445">601</A> 
through <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=88450">606</A> of Title 62 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes shall apply to instruments or payment authorized by this 
subsection.</P>
<P>J. School districts complying with the provisions of this act shall use only 
those forms and accounting systems approved by the State Board of Education. 
Such forms and systems shall be considered in substantial compliance with this 
act if they are sufficient to convey the meaning and sequence of transactions 
contained herein. Provided, nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit 
or prevent the use of additional or subsidiary accounts, forms, or files which 
may be deemed necessary or advisable by the board of education of the district 
or the State Board of Education.</P>
<P>K. Any school district desiring to utilize the services of a data processing 
center to furnish any or all of the records herein required may do so if the 
center and its system complies with this act and the rules and regulations of 
the State Board of Education. Such center shall furnish an honesty bond in an 
amount to be set by the board of education but not less than Ten Thousand 
Dollars ($10,000.00).</P>
<P>L. The State Board of Education shall notify the board of education of the 
school district of the tentative amount the district is to receive from state 
and federal aid funds or allocations, and the board of education of the school 
district may include such tentative estimate as an item of probable income in 
the preparation of the school district's Estimate of Needs and Financial 
Statement; provided, no such federal aid estimate shall be used in any way to 
reduce the State Foundation Aid or Incentive Aid for such school district or 
sustain a protest for the reduction of a tax levy.</P>
