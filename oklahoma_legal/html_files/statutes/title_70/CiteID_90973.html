<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. The board of education shall recognize an employee organization designated 
by an election of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit as the 
exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit. The members of an 
employee organization shall be employees as defined in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of 
this subsection and <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=89755">Section 1-116 of 
this title</A>. The recognition of such employee organization shall be made by 
the board no later than fourteen (14) days after the election. Any person who 
desires not to be represented by any organization may so state in writing to his 
or her board of education. Appropriate bargaining units are defined as follows; 
however, such definition shall not be construed, of itself, as requiring that 
bargaining units engage in bargaining or act to disengage from bargaining:</P>
<P>1. Employees who are employed and certified as principals and assistant 
principals and who have responsibilities for the supervision of classroom 
teachers shall constitute an appropriate unit;</P>
<P>2. All other employees who are required by the position in which employed to 
be certified as teachers that term is defined in <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=89755">Section 1-116 of this title</A> and who 
do not hold supervisory authority with respect to other teachers in the district 
shall constitute an appropriate unit; and</P>
<P>3. All employees who are not required by their job description to be a 
principal, certified teacher, superintendent or other certified or noncertified 
administrator shall constitute a separate bargaining unit. Provided that, 
employees with access to confidential, labor relations information of the school 
district, or managerial employees whose responsibilities include making 
employment recommendations to the superintendent and for which their position 
does not require a certificate, shall be excluded from this or other bargaining 
units. Also excluded is any employee position agreed to be excluded from the 
bargaining unit by the employee organization and the school district.</P>
<P>Provided, if employees categorized according to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this 
subsection were organized for bargaining as a single unit as of April 14, 1986, 
or are at any time employed in a district having fewer than seventy-five 
employees in the two categories taken together, the employees may, for such time 
as a majority of the employees in each category indicate by secret ballot vote 
they share a single community of interest, constitute a single appropriate unit. 
Further provided, any final judgment of the Supreme Court denying such community 
of interest in any school district shall have the effect of rendering 
inappropriate all units, in whatever school districts they exist, which include 
employees of both categories.</P>
<P>B. 1. Within seven (7) business days of receiving a sealed packet containing 
an employee petition filed by or on behalf of thirty-five percent (35%) or more 
of the employees in a unit, such petition calling for an election to determine 
which, if any, employee organization represents the employees in a bargaining 
unit, the board shall arrange for verification that there are a sufficient 
number of correct names to constitute at least thirty-five percent (35%) of the 
employees in the unit. Such arrangements shall include the transmitting of the 
sealed packet and a list of employees eligible to be included in the bargaining 
unit to the individual designated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 of 
this subsection.</P>
<P>2. The petition calling for the secret ballot election shall contain only the 
names of employees of the bargaining unit who have signed and dated the 
petition. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the sealed packet by the 
district court judge in and for the county in which the school district has its 
main office, the sealed packet shall be opened and the petition shall be 
verified by an individual designated by the district judge of such court for the 
county in which the school district has its main office. Upon verification of 
the number of signatures on the petition, the district court judge shall notify 
in writing the district board of education and any employee organization that 
has requested notice of the verification. Under no circumstances shall the 
individual so designated reveal the names of employees who signed or did not 
sign the petition. If an employee has signed more than one petition, the name of 
the employee shall be removed from each petition.</P>
<P>3. The period of time for signing of a recognition petition shall commence 
upon receipt of written notification by the school board from an organization 
indicating that it intends to circulate a petition and shall cease thirty (30) 
days thereafter. Provided, if an organization recognized as representative of a 
unit for bargaining is being challenged for discontinuation of representation as 
provided in paragraph 7 of subsection C of this section or is being challenged 
by another organization seeking recognition, the period for signing shall 
commence on the first day of February and end on the last day of that same 
February.</P>
<P>C. 1. Not less than forty-five (45) days nor more than sixty (60) days after 
receipt of notification that the petition has been verified as sufficient, a 
secret ballot election shall be held to determine which, if any, employee 
organization shall represent the unit. No election shall be held for a unit 
within which a valid election was held in the preceding two (2) years.</P>
<P>On or after March 2, 1995, the board shall recognize within ten (10) days an 
organization which has obtained signed authorization from a majority of the 
employees eligible to be included in the unit but has not been recognized. No 
election shall be held for such unit within two (2) years of recognition. An 
appropriate election ballot shall be printed for this election, which contains 
the names of all employee organizations having presented a petition verified as 
signed by at least thirty-five percent (35%) of the employees eligible to be in 
the unit to represent or currently recognized as representing the unit; 
provided, no such organization shall be shown on the ballot unless the 
organization pays to the board a filing fee of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars 
($250.00). The ballot shall also provide an option whereby any employee of the 
unit may indicate a preference that the unit not be represented by any 
organization. Every organization that receives at least fifteen percent (15%) of 
the vote in the election shall be reimbursed the Two Hundred Fifty Dollars 
($250.00) by the board. The board shall use any remaining filing fee money to 
help offset the cost of the validation process of the petition, if any, as well 
as any election costs incurred.</P>
<P>2. When none of the choices on the ballot receives a majority of the votes, a 
runoff election shall be conducted on the fourteenth day following the first 
election between the two choices which received the largest number of votes in 
the preceding election.</P>
<P>3. The employee organization or organizations and the school board shall, by 
agreement, determine the method by which each election shall be conducted. All 
costs incurred in an election shall be shared equally by all parties 
involved.</P>
<P>If no agreement can be reached by thirty (30) days prior to the election, the 
board of education shall notify the county election board of the county in which 
the board is located of such fact, and the following method for conducting the 
secret ballot election shall be followed and conducted by the county election 
board:</P>
<P>a. At the time of such notice, the board of education shall provide to the 
county election board:</P>
<P>(1) a list of all the polling places for the election, such list to include 
every middle school or junior high school and the central administration office 
in the district;</P>
<P>(2) a list of names of all the persons eligible to vote in the election, such 
list to be in alphabetical order and duplicated in such number that there shall 
be one for each polling place, plus an additional five copies;</P>
<P>(3) the names of each organization entitled to have its name appear on the 
ballot; and</P>
<P>(4) the date of the election which shall not be a special election date 
specified by subsection B of Section 3-101 of Title 26 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</P>
<P>b. Ballots for the election shall be printed by the county election board in 
the same manner as for other elections conducted by the county election board, 
insofar as is possible. The names of organizations shall be listed on the ballot 
in the order in which said names are furnished to the county election board by 
the board of education. The option specifying that no organization shall 
represent the employee bargaining unit shall be listed last on the ballot, in 
such language as may be specified by the board.</P>
<P>c. The secretary of the county election board shall appoint an inspector, 
judge and clerk for each polling place. The inspector, judge and clerk shall be 
selected from among the regular precinct officials in the county.</P>
<P>d. Polling places shall be open from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the day of the 
election. Any eligible person who appears to vote no later than 7:00 p.m. shall 
be entitled to vote.</P>
<P>e. Eligible voters may vote after signing their signatures beside their names 
on the list of names of all the persons eligible to vote in the election. The 
voter shall place his or her ballot in the ballot box in the presence of the 
inspector.</P>
<P>f. Each organization entitled to have its name appear on the ballot shall be 
permitted to appoint one challenger at each polling place. Each such challenger 
shall be properly identified as such, and shall be limited to inquiring of a 
prospective voter, said prospective voter's name, address, job classification 
and work site. The challenger may challenge the right of any prospective voter 
to vote by so informing the judge. Upon being so challenged, the prospective 
voter may vote if, after being informed by the judge of such a challenge, the 
voter signs his or her signature beside his or her name on the list of names of 
all the persons eligible to vote in the election. If same occurs, the judge 
shall write the words "Challenged by _____" beside the voter's signature.</P>
<P>g. The county election board shall certify in writing the results of the 
election to the board of education on the day following the election and on the 
same day shall mail a copy of the certification to all employee organizations 
that have requested copies of the certification.</P>
<P>h. Costs of the election shall be paid to the county election board by the 
board of education. The costs shall include the regular salaries of the 
inspector, judge, and clerk, in addition to all other necessary and reasonable 
costs. Such costs shall include compensation for members of the county election 
board, including the secretary.</P>
<P>i. Anyone guilty of voting more than one time in the election will be guilty 
of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) or 
thirty (30) days in the county jail.</P>
<P>4. No employee shall use regularly scheduled duty time for campaign 
purposes.</P>
<P>5. A list of the employees eligible to vote in the election including their 
names, addresses, phone numbers, job classification and work site shall be 
provided not less than fourteen (14) days before the election to each 
organization listed on the official ballot.</P>
<P>6. Any board or organization challenging the results of any election held 
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall post with the district court a 
bond of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) which shall be forfeited if the court 
finds that the challenge is in bad faith.</P>
<P>7. In any February more than two (2) years after recognition of an 
organization pursuant to the provisions of this section and upon the receipt of 
a petition calling for discontinuation of representation signed by thirty-five 
percent (35%) of the employees eligible to be included in the unit, a board 
shall call an election to determine whether the members of a unit wish to 
discontinue being represented for bargaining. If a majority of the votes cast 
are votes to discontinue representation, efforts to gain recognition by any 
organization shall be prohibited for a period of two (2) years commencing with 
the expiration of the contract then in force. The ballots used in such election 
shall, without reference to any organization by name, offer the single choice of 
continued representation or discontinuation of representation.</P>
