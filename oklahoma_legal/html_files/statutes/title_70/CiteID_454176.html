<p>2.

The psychologist shall report to the employing agency the evaluation of the assessment instrument and may include any additional recommendations to assist the employing agency in determining whether to certify to the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training that the person being evaluated is suitable to serve as a peace officer in this state. No additional procedures or requirements shall be imposed for performance of the psychological evaluation. The psychological instrument utilized shall be evaluated by a psychologist licensed by the State of Oklahoma, and the employing agency shall certify to the Council that the evaluation was conducted in accordance with this provision and that the employee or applicant is suitable to serve as a peace officer in this state.</p>

<p>a. Any person found not to be suitable for employment or certification by the Council shall not be employed, retained in employment as a peace officer, or certified by the Council for at least one (1) year, at which time the employee or applicant may be reevaluated by a psychologist licensed by the State of Oklahoma.

<p>4.

<p>a. The Council may extend the time requirement specified in this paragraph for good cause as determined by the Council.</p>

<p>b. A duty is hereby imposed upon the employing agency to withhold payment of the compensation or wage of such unqualified officer.</p>

<p>c. If the police or peace officer fails to forfeit the position or the employing agency fails to require the officer to forfeit the position, the district attorney shall file the proper action to cause the forfeiting of such position. The district court of the county where the officer is employed shall have jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>

<p>5. The Council may certify officers who have completed a course of study in another state deemed by the Council to meet standards for Oklahoma peace officers providing the officer's certification in the other state has not been revoked or voluntarily surrendered and is not currently under suspension.</p>

<p>6.

<p>a. conviction of a felony or a crime of domestic violence,</p>

<p>b. conviction of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; provided, if the conviction is a single isolated incident that occurred more than five (5) years ago and the Council is satisfied that the person has been sufficiently rehabilitated, the Council may, in its discretion, certify such person providing that all other statutory requirements have been met,</p>

<p>c. a verdict of guilt or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or an "Alford" plea or any plea other than a not guilty plea for a felony offense, a crime of moral turpitude, or a crime of domestic violence,</p>

Provided, the peace officer certification may be reinstated upon the Council receiving notification of a psychological evaluation conducted by a licensed physician, psychologist or licensed mental health professional which attests and states by affidavit that the officer and the evaluation test data of the officer have been examined and that, in the professional opinion of the physician, psychologist or licensed mental health professional, the officer is psychologically suitable to return to duty as a peace officer. Notwithstanding any other provision of state law pertaining to confidentiality of hospital or other medical records, and as allowable under federal law, CLEET may subpoena or request a court to subpoena records necessary to assure compliance with these provisions. Any confidential information received by CLEET for such purpose shall retain its confidential character while in the possession of CLEET,</p>

<p>g. abuse of office,</p>

<p>h. entry of a final order of protection against applicant or officer, or</p>

<p>i. any violation of the Oklahoma Private Security Licensing Act.</p>

<p>2. Disciplinary proceedings shall be commenced by filing a complaint with the Council on a form approved by the Council. Any employing agency or other person having information may submit such information to the Council for consideration as provided in this subsection.</p>

<p>3. Upon the filing of the complaint, a preliminary investigation shall be conducted to determine whether:</p>

<p>a. there is reason to believe the person has violated any provision of this subsection or any other provision of law or rule, or</p>

<p>b. there is reason to believe the person has been convicted of a felony, a crime involving moral turpitude or a domestic violence offense or is currently participating in a deferred sentence for such offenses.</p>

<p>4. When the investigation of a complaint does not find the person has violated any of the provisions of this subsection, or finds that the person is sufficiently rehabilitated as provided in subparagraph b or f of paragraph 1 of this subsection, no disciplinary action shall be required and the person shall remain certified as a police or peace officer. When the investigation of a complaint finds that the person has violated any of the provisions of this subsection, the matter shall be referred for disciplinary proceedings. The disciplinary proceedings shall be in accordance with Articles I and II of the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>

<p>5. The Council shall revoke the certification of any person upon determining that such person has been convicted of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude or a domestic violence offense or has entered a plea of guilty, or nolo contendere or an "Alford" plea or any plea other than a not guilty plea for a felony offense, a crime of moral turpitude or a crime of domestic violence or is the respondent in a final victim protective order; provided, that if the conviction has been reversed, vacated or otherwise invalidated by an appellate court, such conviction shall not be the basis for revocation of certification; provided further, that any person who has been trained and certified by the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training and is actively employed as a full-time peace officer as of November 1, 1985, shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection for convictions occurring prior to November 1, 1985. The sole issue to be determined at the hearing shall be whether the person has been convicted of a felony, a crime involving moral turpitude or a domestic violence offense or is the named respondent/defendant in a final victim protective order.</p>

<p>6. The Council shall revoke the certification of any person upon determining that such person has received a deferred sentence for a felony, a crime involving moral turpitude or a domestic violence offense.</p>

<p>7. The Council may suspend the certification of any person upon a determination that such person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or mental health facility for a mental illness, condition or disorder as provided in subparagraph f of paragraph 1 of this subsection.</p>

<p>8. Every law enforcement agency in this state shall, within thirty (30) days of a final order of termination or resignation while under investigation of a CLEET-certified peace officer, report such order or resignation in writing to the Executive Director of the Council.
