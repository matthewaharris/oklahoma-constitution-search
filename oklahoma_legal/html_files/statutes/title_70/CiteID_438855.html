They shall learn about cultures and environments - their own and those of others with whom they share the earth. All students shall receive the instruction needed to lead healthy and physically active lifestyles. Students, therefore, shall study social studies, literature, languages, the arts, health, mathematics and science. Such curricula shall provide for the teaching of a hands-on career exploration program in cooperation with technology center schools.</p>

<p>6. The subject matter standards for English Language Arts shall give Classic Literature and nonfiction literature equal consideration to other literature. In addition, emphasis shall be given to the study of complete works of literature.</p>

<p>7. At a minimum, the subject matter standards for mathematics shall require mastery of the standard algorithms in mathematics, which is the most logical, efficient way of solving a problem that consistently works, and for students to attain fluency in Euclidian geometry.</p>

<p>8. The subject matter standards for history, social studies and United States Government shall include study of important historical documents, including the United States Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Emancipation Proclamation, Federalist Papers and other documents with significant history and heritage of the United States, and the content of the United States naturalization test, with an emphasis on the specific content of the test and the ideas and concepts it references. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, the United States naturalization test shall be administered in accordance with subsection F of this section.</p>

<p>9. The subject matter standards for United States Government shall include an emphasis on civics, the structure and relationship between the national, state, county and local governments and simulations of the democratic process. For the purposes of this section, civics means the study of the rights and duties of Oklahoma and United States citizens and of how those governments work.</p>

<p>10. The subject matter standards for health and physical education shall include but not be limited to the domains of physical, emotional, social and intellectual health. Health literacy shall include the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Health shall also include the importance of proper nutrition and exercise, mental health and wellness, substance abuse, coping skills for understanding and managing trauma, establishing and maintaining positive relationships and responsible decision making.
