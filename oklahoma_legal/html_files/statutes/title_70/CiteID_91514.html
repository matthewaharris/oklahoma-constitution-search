<p>4. Except for students who qualify pursuant to subsection B of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91512">Section 2603</a> of this title, the determination of financial qualification as set forth in this subsection shall be based on the income of the student, not the income of the parent(s), if the student is determined to be independent of the students parent(s) for federal financial aid purposes. A determination of financial qualification shall not be required for the student who meets the criteria set forth in this subsection at the time the student applies for participation in the program. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any student who has received an Oklahoma Higher Learning Access Program benefit award prior to the 2008-2009 school year.</p>

Certified classroom teacher does not mean a certified teacher who is employed as a school district superintendent, principal, or any other position within the administration of a public school district when his or her child applies for participation in the program or prior to his or her child receiving any Oklahoma Higher Learning Access Program benefit award.</p>

<p>H. The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education shall promulgate rules for the determination of student compliance with agreements made pursuant to this section.</p>

<p>I. The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education shall designate personnel to coordinate tracking of program records for the years when students participating in the program are still in the schools or are being educated by other means, provide staff development for contact persons in the schools, and provide liaison with the State Board of Education and local organizations and individuals participating in the program.</p>

<p>J. The school district where an Oklahoma Higher Learning Access Program student is enrolled when the student begins participation in the program and any subsequent school district where the student enrolls shall forward information regarding participation by the student in the program to a school to which the student transfers upon the request of the school for the records of the student.</p>

<p>K.
