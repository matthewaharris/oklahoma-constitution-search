<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p><span>A. 1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this subsection, the employer of any member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma shall make the following contributions to the System:</span></p>

<p><span>a. beginning July 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999, eleven and one-half percent (11 1/2%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>b. beginning July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, four and eight-tenths percent (4.8%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>c. beginning July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, five and eight-tenths percent (5.8%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>d. beginning July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002, six and eight-tenths percent (6.8%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>e. beginning July 1, 2002, through December 31, 2006, seven and five-hundredths percent (7.05%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>f. beginning January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2007, seven and six-tenths percent (7.6%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>g. beginning July 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, seven and eighty-five hundredths percent (7.85%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>h. beginning January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2008, eight and thirty-five hundredths percent (8.35%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>i. beginning July 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008, eight and five-tenths percent (8.5%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>j. beginning January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, nine percent (9%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member,</span></p>

<p><span>k. beginning January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2010, nine and five-tenths percent (9.5%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member, and</span></p>

<p><span>l. beginning July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, and for each fiscal year thereafter, nine and five-tenths percent (9.5%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>The employer contribution rate increase that would otherwise be effective, as provided by subparagraphs f, g, h, i, j, k and l of this paragraph, shall not become effective as law unless funding levels to each of the affected participating employers within the System are increased so that the additional employer contribution obligation is funded through an appropriation or transfer of monies instead of requiring the additional employer contribution to be paid for from existing budgetary resources of such participating employers. The participating employers shall use any monies specifically made available for purposes of making employer contributions for such purpose and to the extent of the funds made available for that purpose.</span></p>

<p><span>2. a. Beginning January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, a participating employer that employs an employee of a comprehensive university or a regional institution offering a four-year degree program as designated or authorized by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education shall make contributions to the System with respect to such employees at the rate of seven and five-hundredths percent (7.05%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level.</span></p>

<p><span>b. Beginning January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008, a participating employer that employs an employee of a comprehensive university or a regional institution offering a four-year degree program as designated or authorized by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education shall make contributions to the System with respect to such employees at the rate of seven and fifty-five hundredths percent (7.55%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>c. Beginning January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, a participating employer that employs an employee of a comprehensive university or a regional institution offering a four-year degree program as designated or authorized by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education shall make contributions to the System with respect to such employees at the rate of eight and five hundredths percent (8.05%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>d. Beginning January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2010, a participating employer that employs an employee of a comprehensive university or a regional institution offering a four-year degree program as designated or authorized by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education shall make contributions to the System with respect to such employees at the rate of eight and fifty-five hundredths percent (8.55%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>e. Beginning July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, and for each fiscal year thereafter, a participating employer that employs an employee of a comprehensive university or a regional institution offering a four-year degree program as designated or authorized by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education shall make contributions to the System with respect to such employees at the rate of eight and fifty-five hundredths percent (8.55%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>The employer contribution rate increase that would otherwise be effective as provided by subparagraphs b, c, d and e of this paragraph shall not become effective as law unless funding levels are increased so that the additional employer contribution obligation is funded through such an appropriation or transfer of monies instead of requiring the additional employer contribution to be paid for from existing budgetary resources of such participating employers. The participating employers shall use any monies specifically made available for purposes of making employer contributions for such purpose and to the extent of the funds made available for that purpose.</span></p>

<p><span>3. Any employer contribution paid to the System pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered as salary, fringe benefit, or total compensation due to members for the purpose of meeting any legislative or contractual obligation of the employer.</span></p>

<p><span>B. For entities or institutions within The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, the contributions to the System shall be made on regular annual compensation of a member who is an employee of such entity or institution not to exceed the maximum compensation level in effect for the member as prescribed by law.</span></p>

<p><span>C. Employers paying contributions to the System pursuant to subsection A or B of this section shall receive credit for that portion of the gross production tax on natural gas and/or casinghead gas apportioned to the System pursuant to subsection 2 of </span><a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=92254"><span>Section 1004</span></a><span> of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes in meeting the total required employer contribution. On an annual basis, the Board of Trustees of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma shall estimate the net additional cost required to be paid by the contributing employers in order to meet the total employer contribution as provided in subsection A or B of this section. The Board of Trustees shall approve the amount of the additional contribution required to be paid by contributing employers as a percentage of total member salaries and fringe benefits for each fiscal year ending June 30, no later than April 1 of the previous fiscal year. In no event shall the additional contribution required to be paid by the contributing employer under this subsection be less than the contribution required under this subsection in the prior year. In the event actual contributions do not equal the required total contribution as provided in subsection A or B of this section, the net difference between the actual contributions and the required total contributions shall be determined and shall be included in the amount of the additional contribution required to be paid by contributing employers for the next fiscal year. All contributing employers shall pay the same percentage of total member salaries and fringe benefits during each fiscal year. The provisions of this subsection shall terminate June 30, 1999.</span></p>

<p><span>D. Any school district, state college or university, State Board of Education, State Board of Career and Technology Education, or other state agency may, for and on behalf of any member of the System, pay all or any portion of the contribution required by </span><a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=90294"><span>Section 17-108</span></a><span> of this title. Provided, the contribution so paid by any school district, state college or university, State Board of Education, State Board of Career and Technology Education, or other state agency shall be and remain subject to the withdrawal provisions set forth under the System. Wherever the term "contribution" is used, it shall be deemed to include contributions paid for and on behalf of a member by a school district, state college or university, State Board of Education, State Board of Career and Technology Education, or other state agency.</span></p>

<p><span>E. All participating employers shall provide a complete record of the total compensation paid to each employee, including any person who is a retired member of the System, whether or not employer and employee contributions are made with respect to such compensation. The employer shall provide the report required by this subsection on a monthly basis on a form or using such method as the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma may require and shall provide a comprehensive annual report showing the correct compensation, service credit and contributions for the prior fiscal year. Each participating employer shall provide reasonable access to its payroll records, records of contribution payments to the System and all other records relevant to the participation of its employees in the System, to the System, its employees or authorized agents. A participating employer shall cooperate with auditors retained by the System to audit its financial statements or otherwise audit the financial operations of the System.</span></p>
