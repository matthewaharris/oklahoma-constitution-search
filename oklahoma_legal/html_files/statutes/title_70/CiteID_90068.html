<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Except as otherwise provided for in Section 
</FONT><A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=90073"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>7-105</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this title for 
conditional consolidated school districts, the territory comprising all or part 
of a school district may be annexed to another school district or to two or more 
districts, when approved at an annexation election called by the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, but except as provided in subsection B of 
this section, an annexation election may not be held unless the boards of 
education of the affected districts concur therein. Provided, that such 
concurrence of the boards of education affected shall not be required in cases 
of mandatory annexation by the State Board of Education:</FONT><FONT face=Arial> 
</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. In pursuance of a petition for annexation signed 
by a majority of the school district electors in the territory proposed to be 
annexed, hereinafter referred to as the area affected, said majority being 
applied to the highest number of voters voting in a regular school district 
election in the district in the preceding five (5) years as determined by the 
secretary of the county election board, who shall certify the adequacy of the 
number of signatures on the petition as provided in this section; or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. In pursuance of a resolution adopted by the board 
of education of the district in which the area affected is situated. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. An annexation election shall be called by the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction without the concurrence of the board 
of education of the school district which is proposed to be annexed, upon the 
filing of a petition with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for 
annexation that is signed by a majority of the school district electors in the 
territory proposed to be annexed, hereinafter referred to as the area affected, 
said majority being applied to the highest number of voters voting in a regular 
school district election in the district in the preceding five (5) years as 
determined by the secretary of the county election board, who shall certify the 
adequacy of the number of signatures on the petition. The petition shall contain 
such information as the State Superintendent of Public Instruction may require. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Annexation elections held pursuant to this section 
shall be conducted pursuant to the following procedures: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Such election shall be held not less than sixty 
(60) days nor more than ninety (90) days after the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction receives such petition, at some public place in the school 
district in which the area affected is situated, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 
7 p.m., and notice thereof shall be given by the State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction in the same manner as notice of special elections of the school 
district electors of school districts is given, provided, that the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction shall not be required to call an election 
for the purpose of annexing a part of a school district more than once during 
any twelve-month period. Such elections shall be conducted by the county 
election board; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The annexation shall be approved by a majority of 
the school district electors voting at such election: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. of an entire school district, or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. if a majority of the members of a board of 
education of a school district losing the territory concur with the petitioners, 
or resolution, only the legal voters of the area so affected shall be eligible 
to vote at such election, or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. if the affected area is part of a school district 
with thirty thousand (30,000) or more average daily membership, if the 
boundaries of the affected area is not contiguous with the boundaries of the 
rest of the district, and if the boundary of the noncontiguous affected area is 
a least two (2) miles from the nearest boundary of the rest of the district, 
only the legal voters of the area so affected shall be eligible to vote at such 
election. Provided, if there is an incorporated city located wholly within the 
separate noncontiguous affected area, the annexation election being held shall 
not effect the area within the boundaries of the incorporated area unless a 
majority of the school district electors within the boundaries of the 
incorporated area also file a petition requesting annexation as required in 
subsection B of this section. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the area proposed to be annexed constitutes less 
than two percent (2%) of the total area of the school district in which such 
area is located, and there are no qualified electors residing in such area, no 
election shall be held. In such instance the board of education of the school 
district wherein the area proposed to be annexed is located and the board of 
education of the school district to which such area is proposed to be annexed 
shall each adopt a resolution approving such annexation and shall transmit 
certified copies of both resolutions to the State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction who shall, within five (5) days after receiving copies of such 
resolutions, make an order declaring the annexation as approved in the 
resolutions. Copies of the annexation order shall be transmitted to the State 
Board of Education, Oklahoma Tax Commission, county clerk, county treasurer, 
county assessor and to the boards of education of the school districts involved; 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The annexation shall be approved by a majority of 
the school district electors of the area affected, voting at such election, if 
the area affected is an area within a school district in which, as a result of 
condemnation proceedings by the federal government, a majority of the pupils of 
said area have attended school, for at least one school term, in the district to 
which the petition requests annexation; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If the annexation of an entire district is 
approved, as provided for in this section, the State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction shall, within five (5) days after such election, issue an order 
declaring the annexation as requested in the petition or resolution for 
annexation to the State Board of Education, Oklahoma Tax Commission, county 
clerk, county treasurer and county assessor in each county in which any of the 
territory of the disorganized district lies, but the annexation shall not become 
effective until the time for filing an appeal, as hereinafter provided, has 
expired. In the event a majority of the electors voting at such election do not 
vote for the annexation, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall, 
within five (5) days after such election, issue an order denying the annexation 
to the State Board of Education, Oklahoma Tax Commission, county clerk, county 
treasurer and county assessor in each county in which any of the territory of 
the disorganized district lies. Within ten (10) days after the order of the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction is issued, twenty-five percent (25%) 
of the school district electors who were eligible to vote at the annexation 
election may appeal to the district court of the county in which the territory 
proposed to be annexed, or the largest part thereof if such territory lies in 
more than one county, is situated, and thereafter all proceedings shall be 
stayed until the district court has rendered judgment. The proceedings shall be 
given precedence over all other civil matters. In the event the court issues a 
final order upholding a partial annexation, the effective date of said partial 
annexation shall be July 1 following the final order. All pending annexation 
proceedings are hereby exempted from this act. The State Board of Education 
shall be required to change the boundary lines as described in the declaration 
after all litigation has expired; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Upon the effective date of the annexation of an 
entire school district to one or more school districts, the board of education 
of the school district whose territory was annexed shall be declared abolished 
by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. If a school district to which 
the territory was annexed currently has a five-member board of education, that 
school district board of education shall have the option of forming a 
seven-member board of education pursuant to the provisions of Section 5-107A of 
this title upon the effective date of the annexation; and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. If an independent district annexes to an 
elementary district not maintaining a high school, both boards of education are 
abolished. The Governor shall appoint three members of the newly formed district 
to the board of education and these members shall appoint the remaining two 
members. </FONT></P><B><I>
