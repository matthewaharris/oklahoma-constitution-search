<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. a. Between August 1 and December 31 of the year 
following the submission by the United States Department of Commerce to the 
President of the United States of the official Federal Decennial Census, the 
board of education shall reapportion the territory of the school district into 
board districts. Beginning with the reapportionment following the 1990 Federal 
Decennial Census, all boundaries of board districts shall follow clearly 
visible, definable and observable physical boundaries which are based upon 
criteria established and recognized by the Bureau of the Census of the United 
States Department of Commerce for purposes of defining census blocks for its 
decennial census and shall follow, as much as is possible, precinct boundaries. 
Board districts shall be compact, contiguous and shall be as equal in population 
as practical with not more than a ten percent (10%) variance between the most 
populous and least populous board districts.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. School districts having fewer than one thousand 
eight hundred (1,800) students in average daily membership during the preceding 
school year may choose not to establish board districts and may nominate and 
elect all board members at large.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. Elementary school districts shall have board 
members elected at large.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. A city located in an independent school district 
having four or more wards and an outlying area with such outlying area 
comprising no more than twenty percent (20%) of the population of such 
independent school district, then such independent school district may adopt 
such wards and outlying area in lieu of the board districts provided for in 
subparagraph a of this paragraph, and at least one member of the board of 
education of such independent school district shall be a member of each ward; 
and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. One member of the board of education shall be 
elected by the electors of the school district to represent each such board 
district. Provided, however, that in any school district where the electors of 
each board district, rather than the electors of the entire school district, 
elect board members to represent that board district, that district shall elect 
board members in that manner.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If during the term of office to which a person was 
elected, that member ceases to be a resident of the board district for which the 
person was elected, the office shall become vacant and such vacancy shall be 
filled as provided in Section <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=78707">13A-110 
of Title 26</A> of the Oklahoma Statutes; and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. In a school district having more than ten thousand

provisions of Section <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=78698">13A-101</A> et 
seq. of Title 26 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall control as to election of the 
members of the school district's board of education:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. There shall be held an election in which the 
electors of each board district in which a term is expiring or in which a 
vacancy exists shall select two candidates from among the candidates for board 
member to represent the board district,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. If, in the election, one candidate has a majority 
of all votes cast, then a run-off election is not required. If no candidate 
receives a majority of all votes cast, then the two candidates receiving the 
greatest number of votes shall become the candidates for the board district in 
the general election, and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. At the run-off election, all of the electors of 
the board district shall select one of the two candidates as the member of the 
board of education representing the board district.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Any seven-member board shall have the option of 
reducing its board to a five-member board either after approval of a board 
resolution or a vote of the electors of the school district to take such action 
pursuant to Section <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=78706">13A-109 of Title 
26</A> of the Oklahoma Statutes. The election pursuant to a vote of the electors 
of the school district shall be called upon the submission of a petition 
requesting the election signed by ten percent (10%) of the school district 
electors in the school district, the percentage being applied to the highest 
number of voters voting in a regular school district election in the district in 
the preceding five (5) years as determined by the secretary of the county 
election board, who shall certify the adequacy of the number of signatures on 
the petition. If the question is put before the voters of the district, such 
election shall be held along with and at the same time and place as the next 
school election if all requirements of Section <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=78698">13A-101 et seq. of Title 26</A> of the 
Oklahoma Statutes for such election are met.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>After such resolution or election, the board shall

offices shall be abolished at the end of the current board member's term and 
which shall become one of the offices of the new board.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Election of the resulting board members shall be
