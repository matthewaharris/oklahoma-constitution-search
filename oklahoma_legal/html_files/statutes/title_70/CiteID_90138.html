<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. Beginning with the 2014-15 school year, each area of subject matter 
standards, except for standards for career and technology education adopted 
pursuant to <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=90195">Section 14-103 of this 
title</A>, shall be adopted by the State Board of Education and shall be subject 
to legislative review and approval as provided for in Section 4 of this act. The 
subject matter standards shall be implemented statewide by every public school 
district in this state. The subject matter standards shall be thoroughly 
reviewed by the State Board every six (6) years according to and in coordination 
with the existing subject area textbook adoption cycle. After review, the State 
Board shall adopt any revisions in such subject matter standards deemed 
necessary to achieve further improvements in the quality of education for the 
students of this state. Any revisions adopted by the State Board of Education 
shall be subject to review and approval as provided for in Section 4 of this 
act. The adoption of subject matter standards or revisions to the standards by 
the State Board of Education pursuant to this section shall not be promulgated 
as rules and shall not be subject to Article I of the Administrative Procedures 
Act.</P>
<P>B. 1. In addition to the requirements set forth in subsection A of this 
section, on or before August 1, 2016, the State Board of Education, in 
consultation with the State Regents for Higher Education, the State Board of 
Career and Technology Education and the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, shall 
adopt subject matter standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics which 
are college- and career-ready and will replace current standards. To be 
considered college- and career-ready, the standards shall be evaluated by the 
State Department of Education, the State Regents for Higher Education, the State 
Board of Career and Technology Education and the Oklahoma Department of Commerce 
and be determined to be such that the standards will address the goals of 
reducing the need for remedial coursework at the postsecondary level and 
increasing successful completion of postsecondary education. The subject matter 
standards and corresponding student assessments for English Language Arts and 
Mathematics shall be solely approved and controlled by the state through the 
State Board of Education.</P>
<P>2. Upon the effective date of this act, the State Board of Education shall 
begin the process of adopting the English Language Arts and Mathematics 
standards and shall provide reasonable opportunity, consistent with best 
practices, for public comment on the revision of the standards, including but 
not limited to comments from students, parents, educators, organizations 
representing students with disabilities and English language learners, higher 
education representatives, career technology education representatives, subject 
matter experts, community-based organizations, Native American tribal 
representatives and business community representatives.</P>
<P>3. Until the statewide student assessments for English Language Arts and 
Mathematics are implemented as provided for in paragraph 1 of subsection C of 
this section, the State Board of Education shall implement the subject matter 
standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics which were in place prior to 
the revisions adopted by the Board in June 2010.</P>
<P>4. Upon the effective date of this act, the State Board of Education shall 
seek certification from the State Regents for Higher Education that the subject 
matter standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics which were in place 
prior to the revisions adopted by the Board in June 2010 are college- and 
career-ready as defined in the Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
(ESEA) Flexibility document issued by the United States Department of Education 
and referenced in Option B of Principle 1: College and Career-Ready Expectations 
for All Students. The State Regents shall provide the Board a detailed 
description of the certification process and results, including a list of 
deficiencies if the State Regents conclude that the standards are not college- 
and career-ready. The Board shall post all documents, materials, reports, 
descriptions and correspondence produced by the State Regents or used by the 
State Regents in the certification process on the website for the State 
Department of Education.</P>
<P>C. 1. On or before the 2017-18 school year, the State Board of Education, in 
consultation with the State Regents for Higher Education, the State Board of 
Career and Technology Education and the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, shall 
direct the process of the development of annual high-quality statewide student 
assessments for English Language Arts and Mathematics as provided for in Section 
1210.508 of this title that align with the college- and career-ready subject 
matter standards developed pursuant to subsection B of this section.</P>
<P>2. The statewide student assessments for English Language Arts and 
Mathematics shall continue to assess standards and objectives found in the 
subject matter standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics which were in 
place prior to the revisions adopted by the Board in June 2010 and the test 
blueprints shall continue to align to the standards and objectives found in such 
subject matter standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics until the new 
assessments are implemented as provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection. 
</P>
<P>D. 1. The State Board of Education shall not enter into any agreement, 
memorandum of understanding or contract with any federal agency or private 
entity which in any way cedes or limits state discretion or control over the 
process of development, adoption or revision of subject matter standards and 
corresponding student assessments in the public school system, including, but 
not limited to, agreements, memoranda of understanding and contracts in exchange 
for funding for public schools and programs. If the State Board of Education is 
a party to such an agreement, memorandum of understanding or contract on the 
effective date of this act, the State Board of Education shall initiate 
necessary efforts to amend the agreement, memorandum of understanding or 
contract to comply with the requirements of this subsection.</P>
<P>2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the State Board of 
Education from seeking and being granted a waiver from federal law, provided 
that the conditions for the waiver do not require the state to cede or limit its 
discretion or control over the process of development, adoption or revision of 
subject matter standards and corresponding statewide student assessments.</P>
<P>3. The State Department of Education may participate in a multistate or 
multigovernmental cooperative pursuant to the requirements of the Oklahoma 
Central Purchasing Act, but shall not bind the state, contractually or 
otherwise, to the authority of any other state, organization or entity which may 
supersede the authority of the State Board of Education.</P>
<P>E. The content of all subject matter standards and corresponding student 
assessments shall be solely approved and controlled by the state through the 
State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall maintain 
independence of all subject matter standards referenced in <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=438855">Section 11-103.6 of this title</A> and 
corresponding statewide student assessments and shall not relinquish authority 
over Oklahoma subject matter standards and corresponding statewide student 
assessments. Nothing in this section shall prohibit benchmarking the state 
subject matter standards and corresponding student assessments with those of 
other states or nations to allow comparison of Oklahoma subject matter standards 
and corresponding student assessments with those of other states and 
nations.</P>
<P>F. School districts shall exclusively determine the instruction, curriculum, 
reading lists and instructional materials and textbooks, subject to any 
applicable provisions or requirements as set forth in law, to be used in meeting 
the subject matter standards. School districts may, at their discretion, adopt 
supplementary student assessments which are in addition to the statewide student 
assessments.</P>
<P>G. 1. Upon completion of the adoption of English Language Arts and 
Mathematics subject matter standards pursuant to subsection B of this section, 
the State Board of Education shall compare such English Language Arts and 
Mathematics standards with the English Language Arts and Mathematics standards 
that were adopted by the State Board of Education prior to implementation of 
this act. The State Board of Education shall consider public comments, the use 
of best practices, evidence and research in the evaluation of both sets of 
standards. The State Board of Education shall compare the standards in the areas 
of:</P>
<P>a. effective preparation for active citizenship and postsecondary education 
or the workforce,</P>
<P>b. subject matter content,</P>
<P>c. sequencing of subject matter content and relationship to measurement of 
student performance and the application of subject matter standards,</P>
<P>d. developmental appropriateness of grade-level expectations, academic 
content and instructional rigor,</P>
<P>e. clarity for educators and parents,</P>
<P>f. exemplars tied to the standards,</P>
<P>g. measurability of student proficiency in the subject matter,</P>
<P>h. pedagogy,</P>
<P>i. development of critical thinking skills, and</P>
<P>j. demonstration of application of acquired knowledge and skills.</P>
<P>2. Upon completion of the comparison of the English Language Arts and 
Mathematics subject matter standards, the State Board of Education shall submit 
to the Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President Pro 
Tempore of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives and 
the Minority Leader of the Senate a report outlining the results of the 
comparison of the standards.</P>
<P>H. All subject matter standards and corresponding statewide student 
assessments adopted by the State Board of Education shall be carefully 
circumscribed to reflect direct application to subject matter proficiency and 
shall not include standards or assessment questions that are designed to collect 
or measure noncognitive, emotional or psychological characteristics, attributes 
or skills of students.</P>
<P>I. Any rule, including but not limited to Rules 210:15-4-1 through 210:15-4-3 
of the Oklahoma Administrative Code, which conflicts with the requirements of 
this section, shall be amended or repealed by the State Board of Education as 
necessary to comply with the requirements of this section.</P>
