<p><span>c. if the member became a member or is eligible to become a member prior to July 1, 1995, and was eligible to elect to have a maximum compensation level in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and did not elect or elected not to have a maximum compensation level of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00) pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection C of this section or pursuant to subsection E of this section, in an amount equal to:</span></p>

<p><span>(2) two percent (2%) of the member's average salary upon which member contributions were made, multiplied by the number of the member's years of credited service authorized and performed after June 30, 1995.</span></p>

<p><span>B. Except as otherwise provided for in this section, the amount contributed by each member to the retirement system shall be:</span></p>

<p><span>1. Beginning July 1, 1992, through June 30, 1996, six percent (6%) of the regular annual compensation of such member not in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and beginning July 1, 1995, through June 30, 1996, six percent (6%) of the maximum compensation level;</span></p>

<p><span>3. Beginning July 1, 1997, seven percent (7%) of the regular annual compensation of the member not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member; and</span></p>

<p><span>4. All public schools in this state shall treat the employee contributions as being picked up under the provisions of Section 414 (h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in determining tax treatment.</span></p>

<p><span>Subject to Internal Revenue Service approval, paragraph 4 of this subsection shall not apply to a comprehensive university group established on or before July 1, 1998, whose employee contributions were consistently treated as not picked up as of July 1, 1998, and at all times thereafter.</span></p>

<p><span>C. 1. Prior to July 1, 1995, an active member of the System may elect to have a maximum compensation level of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00). Such an election shall be made in writing and filed with the System. Members whose salaries are in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) on July 20, 1987, shall file the election with the System prior to January 1, 1988. Members whose salaries exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) after July 20, 1987, shall file the election when the salary exceeds Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00). If a member makes such an election, the member shall contribute the following amounts:</span></p>

<p><span>a. beginning July 1, 1992, through June 30, 1993, eleven percent (11%) of the regular annual compensation of such member that is in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and is not in excess of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00),</span></p>

<p><span>b. beginning July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, nine percent (9%) of the regular annual compensation of such member that is in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and is not in excess of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00), and</span></p>

<p><span>c. beginning July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995, eight percent (8%) of the regular annual compensation of such member that is in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and is not in excess of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00). Except as provided in subsection E of this section, any such election shall be irrevocable.</span></p>

<p><span>2. After June 30, 1995, in addition to the amount contributed by each member to the retirement system pursuant to subsection B of this section, the total amount contributed by each member to the retirement system shall include, beginning July 1, 1995, through June 30, 1997, seven percent (7%) of the regular annual compensation of each member, who is not employed by an entity or institution within The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, that is in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and beginning July 1, 1996, through June 30, 1997, seven percent (7%) of the regular annual compensation of each member who is employed by an entity or institution within The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), but not in excess of any applicable maximum compensation level of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>D. 1. Any member who was a contributing member of the Retirement System between July 1, 1987, and June 30, 1995, who at the time the member was eligible to make an election to increase the maximum compensation level of the member, failed to make an election or chose not to increase the maximum compensation level of the member to Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00), may elect to make back contributions to the Retirement System. The member shall complete a new election form and file with the Board of Trustees, the form and a payment equaling the difference between the amount contributed at the twenty-five-thousand-dollar level and the appropriate contribution on compensation in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) up to a maximum of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00) shall be made prior to the official retirement date of the member. The required payment shall include any contribution required by the employing school district, and shall include interest compounded annually at ten percent (10%) per annum of both employer and employee contributions.</span></p>

<p><span>2. Any changes made pursuant to this subsection shall be irrevocable.</span></p>

<p><span>E. 1. An individual who withdrew from the Teachers' Retirement System and whose salary was in excess of Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($7,800.00) and had elected to contribute only on Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($7,800.00) before his or her withdrawal shall contribute on the earning ceiling as provided for in this section on his or her reentry into membership in the Teachers' Retirement System.</span></p>

<p><span>2. An individual who elected to contribute on a maximum of Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($7,800.00) per annum shall, beginning July 1, 1979, contribute on his or her earning ceiling as provided for in this section.</span></p>

<p><span>3. Any member who elected to contribute on Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($7,800.00) prior to January 1, 1978, and whose salary was more than Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($7,800.00) during the school years 1974-75 through 1978-79 may elect to make back contributions to the retirement system by paying the five percent (5%) contributions on the difference between Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($7,800.00) and the actual salary of the member, not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) for each applicable school year, plus interest compounded annually at ten percent (10%) per annum. Such payment shall be made prior to the official retirement date of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>F. Each employer shall cause to be deducted from the salary of each member on each and every payroll of such employer for each and every payroll period, the proper percentage of his or her earnable compensation as provided for in subsection B or subsection C of this section.</span></p>

<p><span>1. Deductions shall begin with the first payroll period of the school year. In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the Board of Trustees shall consider the rate of annual compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period, and it may omit deductions from compensation for any period less than a full period, and to facilitate the making of deductions, it may modify the deduction required of any member by such an amount as shall not exceed one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of the annual compensation upon the basis of which such deduction is to be made. Prior to January 1, 1991, any active contributing member who joined the System subsequent to July 1, 1943, may pay the normal cost, which shall mean the single sum which would have been paid under existing statutes at the time the service was performed, plus interest, for years of teaching service in Oklahoma from the date of establishment of the System in 1943 to date of membership, in a lump sum, or in installments equal to establishing one (1) year of creditable service. Effective January 1, 1991, any active contributing member who joined the System subsequent to July 1, 1943, may pay the amount determined by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Section 17-116.8 of this title for years of teaching service in Oklahoma from the date of establishment of the System in 1943 to date of membership, in a lump sum, or in installments equal to establishing one (1) year of creditable service. For purposes of this option, teaching service in Oklahoma shall include the teaching of vocational agricultural courses within Oklahoma for the federal government. Years for which contributions are paid shall count as membership service under this plan. A member may receive credit for not more than five (5) years of teaching service rendered while in the Peace Corps or in the public schools of a territory of the United States or the public schools, American Military Dependent Schools or state colleges or state universities outside this state by paying his or her contributions, plus interest, and membership fees to the retirement system, subject to the regulations of the Board of Trustees, providing he or she is not receiving and is not eligible to receive retirement credit or benefits from said service in any other public retirement system of this state, or any other state or territory of the United States subject to the following provisions:</span></p>

<p><span>a. the member is required to have two (2) years of employed service teaching earned in Oklahoma for each year of Peace Corps, territorial, out-of-state, noncovered in-state or military membership credit granted.</span></p>

<p><span>b. prior to January 1, 1991, the out-of-state or noncovered in-state payment shall be the normal cost, which means the single sum which would have been paid under existing law at the time the service was performed, plus interest, on the basis of what his or her annual salary would have been in Oklahoma or out of state, whichever is greater, had he or she been employed as a teacher. Effective January 1, 1991, the Peace Corps, territorial, out-of-state or noncovered in-state payment shall be the amount determined by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Section 17-116.8 of this title.</span></p>

<p><span>2. In addition to the deductions hereinabove provided for, any member who becomes a member of the Armed Forces of the United States of America during any period of national emergency, including World War II, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam conflict or others as may be determined by the Board of Trustees, or whose entrance into or training for the teaching profession was interrupted by his or her entrance into the Armed Forces, and who was or shall have become a member of the Teachers' Retirement System shall be granted the privilege of making up his or her five percent (5%) contributions as provided for in this section until January 1, 1991, for not to exceed five (5) years of service in the Armed Forces by electing to pay said contributions on the basis of the rate of pay in his or her contract as a teacher at the time his or her service in the Armed Forces commenced or in the case of a teacher who was not teaching prior to entering the Armed Forces, on the basis of the salary of the first year of teaching after being honorably discharged from the Armed Forces. Effective January 1, 1991, the member will receive such service upon payment of the amount determined by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Section 17-116.8 of this title. Such contributions shall be credited in the regular manner, and the period for which said contributions were paid shall be counted as creditable years of service and allocated to the period during which the military service was rendered, except that the period for which contributions were paid must have been continuous and shall be credited in the aggregate, regardless of fiscal year limitations. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service as defined by Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986</span><span><strike>,</strike></span><span> shall be provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code.</span></p>

<p><span>3. Retirement benefits for all service credits purchased pursuant to this subsection shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this subsection.</span></p>

<p><span>G. Effective July 1, 2004, the total creditable service of a member who retires or terminates employment and elects a vested benefit shall include not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days of unused sick leave accumulated subsequent to August 1, 1959. Twenty (20) days of unused sick leave shall equal one (1) month for purposes of creditable service credit. If the member becomes a member or was eligible to become a member prior to July 1, 1995, the year of credit received in this section shall be treated as service earned prior to July 1, 1995. This subsection shall apply to members retiring or vesting on or after the effective date of this act and shall not be retroactive.</span></p>

<p><span>H. Any member who:</span></p>

<p><span>1. Shall be absent from the teaching service because of election to the State Legislature or appointment to the executive branch in an education-related capacity shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the date as of which the person is officially elected or appointed to file an election with the Teachers' Retirement System to retain his or her membership in the Teachers' Retirement System upon payment of the contribution required of other members and employers of said members as provided for in this section and his or her service credits shall continue to be accumulated during such absence, provided he or she is not receiving retirement credits or benefits from said service beginning after July 1, 1992, in other public retirement systems; or</span></p>

<p><span>2. Became an employee of the Oklahoma Commission for Teacher Preparation on or subsequent to June 1, 2001, but prior to July 1, 2002, who was previously employed by a participating employer within the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma, may elect to cancel any accumulated service credit accrued within the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System on or after June 1, 2001, but prior to July 1, 2002, by filing an election with the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System for the cancellation of such service credit. The election shall be irrevocable and shall require the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System to transfer all accumulated employer and employee contributions made on behalf of or by the person making such election to the Teachers' Retirement System for such period of time. The Teachers' Retirement System shall compute the employee contributions that would have been made to the System by such employee if the contributions had been computed pursuant to this section. In order to receive the full amount of creditable service for the period of time on or after June 1, 2001, but not later than June 30, 2002, the employee shall be required to pay any difference between the transferred employee contributions and the amount computed by the Teachers' Retirement System. The employee may make payment of any required amount in the manner provided by and subject to the requirements of Section 17-116.8 of this title. After payment of all required employee contributions, the Teachers' Retirement System shall credit the period of time represented by the transferred employee contributions as creditable service within the meaning of Section 17-101 of this title. After the transfer of the employee contributions, the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System shall cancel any service credit previously accumulated for the period of time represented by such transferred employee contributions. Any person who makes the election provided for by this paragraph, and who continues employment with the Oklahoma Commission for Teacher Preparation on or after July 1, 2002, shall continue to accrue service credit in the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma. The employer shall make employer contributions according to the requirements of Section 17-108.1 of this title and shall provide for the deduction of employee contributions as required by this section.</span></p>

<p><span>I. Any member who shall be absent from the teaching service because of election or appointment as a local, state or national education association officer, prior to January 1, 2011, shall be allowed to retain his or her membership in the Teachers' Retirement System upon payment of the contribution required of other members and employers of said members as provided for in this section and his or her service credits shall continue to be accumulated during such absence. Provided, however, any one such absence shall not exceed twelve (12) continuous years. No member who has less than ten (10) years of contributory service on July 1, 1994, may make this election after June 30, 1994. Members contributing to the System on July 1, 1994, may continue to contribute under this subsection until they have completed eight (8) years allowed by this subsection. The member may file for retirement when otherwise eligible for retirement as provided by Section 17-105 of this title.</span></p>

<p><span>J. A member may receive credit for those years of service accumulated by the member while employed by an entity which is a participating employer in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System, the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System, the Uniform Retirement System for Justices and Judges, the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System, or the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System, if the member is not receiving or eligible to receive retirement credit or benefits from said service in any other public retirement system. A member also may receive credit for those years of service with the Department of Wildlife Conservation or with an employer that is a participating employer within one of the state retirement systems specifically referred to in this section when at the time of such service by the member the employer was not such a participating employer, if the member is not receiving or eligible to receive retirement credit or benefits from said service in any other public retirement system. To receive the service credit provided in this subsection, the member shall pay the amount determined by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Section 17-116.8 of this title. For purposes of this subsection, creditable service transferred from the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System shall include service authorized under paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of Section 913 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes as amended from time to time. Members who retire prior to July 1, 1993, shall have their monthly benefit adjusted to include all services accrued under paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of Section 913 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Provided however, any adjustment of existing retirement benefits caused by reason of inclusion of such service authorized under paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of Section 913 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall not affect any retirement benefit paid prior to July 1, 1993.</span></p>

<p><span>K. 1. An active member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma may receive credit for those years of service accumulated by the member while a member of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System if:</span></p>

<p><span>a. the member is an active member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma, and</span></p>

<p><span>b. the member provides notice to the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System and the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma of the member's election to transfer said service credit. The notice shall include a list of the years to be transferred, and</span></p>

<p><span>c. the member is not receiving or eligible to receive retirement credit or benefits from said service in any other public retirement system, notwithstanding the years of service sought to be transferred under this subsection.</span></p>

<p><span>Members electing to take advantage of the transfer authorized by this subsection who are receiving or eligible to receive retirement credit or benefits from said service in any other public retirement system shall have all service credit with the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System canceled which is not transferred to the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma or used as a cash offset in such a transfer pursuant to subparagraph d of paragraph 2 of this subsection. Service credit transferred to the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma under this subsection shall also be canceled with the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System.</span></p>

<p><span>2. For purposes of this subsection, the "sending system" shall mean the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System. The "receiving system" shall mean the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma.</span></p>

<p><span>a. Within thirty (30) days notification of an intent to transfer is received by the sending system, the sending system shall, according to its own rules and regulations:</span></p>

<p><span>(1) for members who have accrued at least eight (8) years of credited service with the sending system, determine the present value of the member's earned benefits attributable to the years of service sought to be transferred, discounted according to the member's age at the time of transfer and computed as of the earliest age at which the member would be able to retire. Said computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be computed using interest and mortality assumptions consistent with the actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation, but shall not make any projections regarding future salary. For employees who have accrued at least eight (8) years of credited service, the sending system shall use the product of this calculation for purposes of determining the transfer fee to be paid by the employee under subparagraph c of this paragraph so long as it is greater than the product of the calculation in division (2) of this subparagraph, and</span></p>

<p><span>(2) determine the sum of the employee and employer contributions applicable to the years of service sought to be transferred plus interest consistent with the actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation. For all nonvested members, and for members who have accrued at least eight (8) years of credited service, if the product of this calculation is greater than the product of the calculation in division (1) of this subparagraph, the sending system shall use the product of this calculation for purposes of determining the amount to be transferred by the sending system under subparagraph c of this paragraph and any transfer fee to be paid by the member under subparagraph d of this paragraph.</span></p>

<p><span>b. Within thirty (30) days notification of an intent to transfer is received by the receiving system, the receiving system shall determine, according to the system's own rules and regulations, the present value of the member's incremental projected benefits discounted according to the member's age at the time of the transfer. Incremental projected benefits shall be the difference between the projected benefit said member would receive without transferring the service credit and the projected benefit after transfer of service credit computed as of the earliest age at which the member would be able to retire. Said computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be computed using interest, salary projections and mortality assumptions consistent with the actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation.</span></p>

<p><span>c. The sending system shall, within sixty (60) days from the date notification of an intent to transfer is received by the sending system, transfer to the receiving system the amount determined in subparagraph a of this paragraph. Except if the cost as calculated under subparagraph a of this paragraph is greater than the actuarial value of the incremental benefit in the receiving system, as established in subparagraph b of this paragraph, the sending system shall send the receiving system an amount equal to the actuarial value of the incremental projected benefit in the receiving system.</span></p>

<p><span>d. In order to receive the credit provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection, if the cost of the actuarial value of the incremental benefit to the receiving system is greater than the cost as calculated under subparagraph a of this paragraph for the same years of service to the sending system as established in subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph, the employee shall elect to:</span></p>

<p><span>(1) pay any difference to receive full credit for the years sought to be transferred, or</span></p>

<p><span>(2) receive prorated service credit for only the amount received from the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System pursuant to this subsection.</span></p>

<p><span>Such an election shall be made in writing, filed with the System prior to receiving the credit provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection, and shall be irrevocable.</span></p>

<p><span>3. Within sixty (60) days of successfully completing all of the requirements for transfer under this subsection, the sending system shall pay the receiving system any amount due under this subsection. Within sixty (60) days of successfully completing all of the requirements for transfer under this subsection, the member shall pay the receiving system any amount due under this subsection. In the event that the member is unable to pay the transfer fee provided for in this subsection by the due date, the Board of Trustees of the receiving system shall permit the member to amortize the transfer fee over a period not to exceed sixty (60) months. Said payments shall be made by payroll deductions unless the Board of Trustees permits an alternate payment source. The amortization shall include interest in an amount not to exceed the actuarially assumed interest rate adopted by the Board of Trustees for investment earnings each year. Any member who ceases to make payment, terminates, retires or dies before completing the payments provided for in this section shall receive prorated service credit for only those payments made, unless the unpaid balance is paid by said member, his or her estate or successor in interest within six (6) months after said member's death, termination of employment or retirement, provided no retirement benefits shall be payable until the unpaid balance is paid, unless said member or beneficiary affirmatively waives the additional six-month period in which to pay the unpaid balance.</span></p>

<p><span>4. Years of service transferred pursuant to this subsection shall be used both in determining the member's retirement benefit and in determining the years of service for retirement and/or vesting purposes. Years of service rendered as a member of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System prior to July 1, 1992, if any, shall be deemed to be years of service rendered as a member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma prior to July 1, 1992, and shall qualify such person as a member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma before July 1, 1992.</span></p>

<p><span>5. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (5) of Section 917 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes, members electing to take advantage of the transfer authorized by this subsection who have withdrawn their contributions from the sending system shall remit to the sending system the amount of the accumulated contributions the member has withdrawn plus simple interest of ten percent (10%) per annum prior to making said election or the election shall be deemed invalid and the transfer shall be canceled. If such an election is deemed invalid and the transfer is canceled, the accumulated contribution remitted to the sending system by the member who originally withdrew their contributions shall be returned to the member. The member's rights and obligations regarding any service credit reestablished in the sending system due to a failure to satisfy the requirements of this subsection shall be determined by the sending system in accordance with Section 901 et seq. of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</span></p>

<p><span>6. If any member fails for any reason to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, the election to transfer service credit shall be void and of no effect, and any service credited as a result of this transfer shall be canceled. If such service is canceled, the years of canceled service credit which were unsuccessfully transferred to the receiving system from the sending system shall be reestablished in the sending system. The member's rights and obligations regarding any service credit reestablished in the sending system due to a failure to satisfy the requirements of this subsection shall be determined by the sending system in accordance with Section 901 et seq. of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</span></p>

<p><span>7. The Board of Trustees shall promulgate such rules as are necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection.</span></p>

<p><span>L. Any member whose regular annual compensation was not determined as provided for by law may pay the member contribution required pursuant to subsection B of this section on such amount not included in the member's regular annual compensation and receive credit for such amount in the calculation of the member's benefit. The employees must pay the employer contributions required pursuant to Section 17-108.1 of this title. Interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum shall be charged to both employee and employer contributions. Provided that the employing district may pay all or any portion of the contributions and interest the member is required to pay. Any payment by the employing district for a prior year obligation shall be considered a current obligation of the employer.</span></p>

<p><span>M. Any active member who elected during the 1978-79 school year to pay the difference between five percent (5%) on actual salary not exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) and six percent (6%) on actual salary not exceeding Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) shall receive credit for one (1) year of credited service upon receipt and approval of a proper request by the Board of Trustees.</span></p>

<p><span>N. Effective July 1, 1988, any member who is employed by the Governor, the State Senate, the House of Representatives or the Legislative Service Bureau shall be allowed to elect to retain membership in the Retirement System upon payment of the accrued and current member contributions and employer contributions as provided in subsection B of this section and Section 17-108.1 of this title. Such contributions may be paid on behalf of the member by the employing entity. Upon payment of such contributions, service credits shall continue to be accumulated during such employment. Accrued contributions shall be paid to the Retirement System by August 1, 1989. Current contributions shall be paid to the Retirement System by the tenth of the following month beginning with the month of July 1989.</span></p>

<p><span>O. Notwithstanding any requirements of this title to restrict the payment of service purchases, the Board of Trustees shall promulgate such rules as necessary to allow active members of the System to make installment payments for the redeposit of withdrawn accounts or other payments due under the provisions of this title. The rules shall permit the member to amortize the balance due over a period not to exceed sixty (60) months, and shall include interest consistent with the actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation. Further, the rules shall provide that all payments must be completed prior to the effective retirement date of the member.</span></p>

<p><span>P. 1. A member of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System who becomes a member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma because the member has become employed by an entity or institution within The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, State Board of Education, State Board of Career and Technology Education, Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education, Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology, State Department of Rehabilitation Services, Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, Department of Corrections, State Department of Education, Oklahoma Board of Private Vocational Schools, Board of Regents of Oklahoma Colleges, Oklahoma Student Loan Authority, or the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma, may elect to receive credit in the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma for those years of service accumulated by the member in the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System pursuant to this subsection. A member shall be eligible to elect to receive credit for such years of service if:</span></p>

<p><span>a. the member is an active member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma,</span></p>

<p><span>b. the member provides notice to the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System of the member's election to transfer such retirement credit. The notice shall include a list of the years to be transferred, and</span></p>

<p><span>c. the member is not receiving or eligible to receive retirement credit or benefits from such service in any other public retirement system, notwithstanding the years of service sought to be transferred under this subsection.</span></p>

<p><span>Members electing to take advantage of the transfer authorized by this subsection shall have all service credit with the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System canceled which is transferred to the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma.</span></p>

<p><span>2. For purposes of this subsection, the "sending system" shall mean the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System. The "receiving system" shall mean the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma. Within thirty (30) days after notification of an intent to transfer is received by the sending system, the sending system shall, according to its own rules, send to the receiving system all employer and employee contributions made on behalf of the member which were made to the sending system plus an additional amount of earnings based on the actuarial assumed rate of the sending system. Upon receipt of these contributions by the receiving system, the receiving system shall give credit to the transferring member in an amount equal to the years of service accrued in the sending system.</span></p>

<p><span>3. If the transferring member's normal retirement date calculation is based upon the sum of the member's age and number of years of credited service totaling eighty (80) in the sending system, then the member shall retain such calculation in the receiving system.</span></p>

<p><span>4. The Board of Trustees shall promulgate such rules as are necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection.</span></p>

<p><span>Q. A former member of the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma who withdrew his or her contributions from the System prior to January 1, 1983, and who had at least ten (10) years of service in the System and purchased that service in the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System, may elect to revoke that purchase from the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System and to repay the withdrawn contributions to the System in order to be eligible, once such member reaches the normal retirement age, to receive a retirement benefit that is based upon years of service and compensation at the time such member terminated employment. In addition, such former member may elect to transfer service credit accrued in the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System to the Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma pursuant to subsection K of this section. The election, pursuant to this subsection, shall be made prior to September 1, 2000. The election and the repayment shall be made according to rules promulgated by the Board.</span></p>
