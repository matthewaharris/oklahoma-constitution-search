to pay costs associated with the issuance and administration of such 
obligations.</P>
<P>D. The obligations authorized under this section may be sold at either 
competitive or negotiated sale, as determined by the Oklahoma Capitol 
Improvement Authority, and in such form and at such prices and bearing interest 
at a fixed or variable rate as may be authorized by the Oklahoma Capitol 
Improvement Authority. The Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority may enter into 
agreements with such credit enhancers and liquidity providers as may be 
determined necessary to efficiently market the obligations. The obligations may 
mature and have such provisions for redemption as shall be determined by the 
Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority.</P>
<P>E. Any interest earnings on funds or accounts created for the purposes of 
this section may be utilized as partial payment of the annual debt service or 
for the purposes directed by the Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority. The 
interest earnings in the construction funds created pursuant to this section 
shall be used by the Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority for the projects 
enumerated herein.</P>
<P>F. The obligations issued under this section, the transfer thereof and the 
interest earned on such obligations, including any profit derived from the sale 
thereof, shall not be subject to taxation of any kind by the State of Oklahoma, 
or by any county, municipality or political subdivision therein.</P>
<P>G. The Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority may direct the investment of 
all monies in any funds or accounts created in connection with the offering of 
the obligations authorized under this section. Such investments shall be made in 
a manner consistent with the investment guidelines of the State Treasurer. The 
Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority may place additional restrictions on the 
investment of such monies if necessary to enhance the marketability of the 
obligations.</P>
<P>H. The Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority is authorized to issue bonds, 
notes, or other obligations for the purpose of refinancing or restructuring 
obligations issued pursuant to this section. To the extent funds are available 
from the proceeds of the borrowing authorized by this subsection, the Oklahoma 
Capitol Improvement Authority shall provide for the payment of professional fees 
and associated costs approved by the Oklahoma State Bond Advisor. The Oklahoma 
Capitol Improvement Authority is authorized to hire bond counsel, financial 
consultants, and such other professionals as may be deemed necessary to provide 
for the efficient sale of the obligations and may utilize a portion of the 
proceeds of any borrowing to create such reserves as may be deemed necessary and 
to pay costs associated with the issuance and administration of such 
obligations. An issuance of bonds under this subsection may be undertaken to 
achieve an overall debt service savings, modify restrictive bond document 
covenants, or reduce payment requirements during periods of fiscal stress. To 
achieve these objectives, the Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority is 
authorized to extend the final maturity of outstanding obligations if necessary, 
but in no event shall the final maturity of an individual bond issue be extended 
more than ten (10) years without the approval of the Council of Bond Oversight. 
The obligations authorized under this subsection may be sold at either 
competitive or negotiated sale, as determined by the Oklahoma Capitol 
Improvement Authority, and in such form and at such prices as may be authorized 
by the Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority. The Oklahoma Capitol Improvement 
Authority may issue obligations in one or more series and may set such other 
terms and conditions as may be necessary in its judgment to achieve an efficient 
refinancing. The Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority may enter into 
agreements with such credit enhancers and liquidity providers as may be 
determined necessary to efficiently market the obligations, including the 
purchase of surety policies or other financial instruments to be utilized in 
lieu of reserve funds. The obligations may mature and have such provisions for 
redemption as shall be determined by the Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority. 
The Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority is hereby specifically authorized to 
purchase surety policies or other financial instruments to replace existing debt 
service reserves. Any payment for such policies or other instruments may be made 
from the cash reserves being replaced or any other legally available source.</P>
<P>I. Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the 
provisions of Section 3980.4 of this title.</P>
