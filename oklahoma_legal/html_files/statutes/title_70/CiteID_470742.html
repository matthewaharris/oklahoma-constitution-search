<p>A. This section shall be known and may be cited as the "Student Data Accessibility, Transparency and Accountability Act of 2013".</p>

<p>7. "Student data" means data collected and/or reported at the individual student level included in a student's educational record.</p>

<p>a. "Student data" includes:</p>

<p>(1) juvenile delinquency records,</p>

<p>(2) criminal records,</p>

<p>(3) medical and health records,</p>

<p>(4) student Social Security number, and</p>

<p>(5) student biometric information; and</p>

<p>8. "Military student identifier" means a unique identifier for each student whose parent or guardian is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard which will allow for the disaggregation of each category.</p>

<p>C. The State Board of Education shall:</p>

<p>1. Create, publish and make publicly available a data inventory and dictionary or index of data elements with definitions of individual student data fields currently in the student data system including:</p>

<p>a. any individual student data required to be reported by state and federal education mandates,</p>

<p>b. any individual student data which has been proposed for inclusion in the student data system with a statement regarding the purpose or reason for the proposed collection, and</p>

<p>2. Develop, publish and make publicly available policies and procedures to comply with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and other relevant privacy laws and policies, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>a. access to student and de-identified data in the student data system shall be restricted to:</p>

<p>(3) students and their parents, and</p>

<p>(4) the authorized staff of other state agencies in Oklahoma as required by law and/or defined by interagency data-sharing agreements,</p>

<p>b. the State Department of Education shall use only aggregate data in public reports or in response to record requests in accordance with paragraph 3 of this subsection,</p>

<p>c. the State Department of Education shall develop criteria for the approval of research and data requests from state and local agencies, the State Legislature, researchers and the public:</p>

<p>(1) unless otherwise approved by the State Board of Education, student data maintained by the State Department of Education shall remain confidential, and</p>

<p>(2) unless otherwise approved by the State Board of Education to release student or de-identified data in specific instances, the Department may only use aggregate data in the release of data in response to research and data requests, and</p>

<p>d. notification to students and parents regarding their rights under federal and state law;</p>

<p>3. Unless otherwise approved by the State Board of Education, the State Department of Education shall not transfer student or de-identified data deemed confidential under division (1) of subparagraph c of paragraph 2 of this subsection to any federal, state or local agency or other organization/entity outside of the State of Oklahoma, with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>c. a student registers for or takes a national or multistate assessment,</p>

<p>d. a student voluntarily participates in a program for which such a data transfer is a condition/requirement of participation,</p>

<p>e. the Department enters into a contract that governs databases, assessments, special education or instructional supports with an out-of-state vendor,</p>

<p>f. a student is classified as "migrant" for federal reporting purposes, or</p>

<p>g. a student with a military student identifier for purposes of assisting the Department of Defense in developing policy and military child education initiatives;</p>

<p>4. Develop a detailed data security plan that includes:</p>

<p>a. guidelines for authorizing access to the student data system and to individual student data including guidelines for authentication of authorized access,</p>

<p>b. privacy compliance standards,</p>

<p>c. privacy and security audits,</p>

<p>d. breach planning, notification and procedures, and</p>

<p>e. data retention and disposition policies;</p>

<p>5. Ensure routine and ongoing compliance by the State Department of Education with FERPA, other relevant privacy laws and policies, and the privacy and security policies and procedures developed under the authority of this act, including the performance of compliance audits;</p>

<p>6. Ensure that any contracts that govern databases, assessments or instructional supports that include student or de-identified data and are outsourced to private vendors include express provisions that safeguard privacy and security and include penalties for noncompliance;</p>

<p>7. Notify the Governor and the Legislature annually of the following:</p>

<p>a. new student data proposed for inclusion in the state student data system:</p>

<p>(1) any new student data collection proposed by the State Board of Education becomes a provisional requirement to allow districts and their local data system vendors the opportunity to meet the new requirement, and</p>

<p>(2) the State Board of Education must submit any new "provisional" student data collection to the Governor and the Legislature for their approval within one (1) year in order to make the new student data a permanent requirement. Any provisional student data collection not approved by the Governor and the Legislature by the end of the next legislative session expires and is no longer required,</p>

<p>b. changes to existing data collections required for any reason, including changes to federal reporting requirements made by the U.S. Department of Education,</p>

<p>c. an explanation of any exceptions granted by the State Board of Education in the past year regarding the release or out-of-state transfer of student or de-identified data, and</p>

<p>d. the results of any and all privacy compliance and security audits completed in the past year. Notifications regarding privacy compliance and security audits shall not include any information that would itself pose a security threat to the state or local student information systems or to the secure transmission of data between state and local systems by exposing vulnerabilities; and</p>

<p>8. By July 1, 2016, include a military student identifier in the state student data system.</p>

<p>D. The State Board of Education shall adopt rules for the State Department of Education to implement the provisions of the Student Data Accessibility, Transparency and Accountability Act of 2013.</p>

<p>E. Upon the effective date of this act, any existing collection of student data by the State Department of Education and the addition of a military student identifier to the student data collected by the Department after the effective date of this act shall not be considered a new student data collection in accordance with subparagraph a of paragraph 7 of subsection C of this section.</p>

<p>F. Nothing in this act shall interfere with the State Department of Education's compliance with the Educational Accountability Reform Act.</p>
