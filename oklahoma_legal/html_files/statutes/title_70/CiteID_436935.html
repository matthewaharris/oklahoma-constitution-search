<p><strong><em>Multiple Amendments Enacted During the 2025 Legislative Session</em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Version 1 (Amended by Laws 2025, SB 553, c. 101, § 5, emerg. eff. July 1, 2025)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>A. The district boards of education of this state shall establish professional development programs for the certified teachers and administrators of the district. Programs shall be adopted by each board based upon recommendations of a professional development committee appointed by the board of education for the district.</p>

<p>B. Each professional development committee shall include classroom teachers, administrators, school counselors or licensed mental health providers, and parents, guardians, or custodians of children in the school district and shall consult with a higher education faculty. A majority of the members of the professional development committee shall be composed of classroom teachers. The teacher members shall be selected by a designated administrator of the school district from a list of names submitted by the teachers in the school district. The members selected shall be subject to the approval of a majority vote of the teachers in the district.</p>

<p>C. In developing program recommendations, each professional development committee shall annually utilize a data-driven approach to analyze student data and determine district and school professional development needs. The professional development programs adopted shall be directed toward development of competencies and instructional strategies in the core curriculum areas for the following goals:</p>

<p>1. Increasing the academic performance data scores for the district and each school site;</p>

<p>2. Closing achievement gaps among student subgroups;</p>

<p>3. Increasing student achievement as demonstrated on state-mandated tests and the ACT;</p>

<p>4. Increasing high school graduation rates; and</p>

<p>5. Decreasing college remediation rates.</p>

<p>Each program may also include components on classroom management and student discipline strategies, outreach to parents, guardians, or custodians of students, special education, and racial and ethnic education, which all personnel defined as teachers in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=89755">Section 1-116</a> of this title shall be required to complete at a frequency as determined by the board of education. The State Board of Education shall provide guidelines to assist school districts in developing and implementing racial and ethnic education components into professional development programs.</p>

<p>D. A program which includes the following information shall be completed the first year a certified teacher is employed by a school district, and then once every fifth academic year:</p>

<p>1. Training on recognition of child abuse and neglect;</p>

<p>2. Recognition of child sexual abuse;</p>

<p>3. Proper reporting of suspected abuse including the reporting requirements of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=455989">Section 1-2-101 of Title 10A</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=483030">Section 1210.163</a> of this title and associated penalties for failure to report; and</p>

<p>4. Available resources.</p>

<p>E. One time per year, beginning in the 2009-2010 school year, training in the area of autism shall be offered and all resident teachers of students in early childhood programs through grade three shall be required to complete the autism training during the resident year and at least one time every three (3) years thereafter. All other teachers and education support professionals of students in early childhood programs through grade three shall be required to complete the autism training at least one time every three (3) years. The autism training shall include a minimum awareness of the characteristics of autistic children, resources available and an introduction to positive behavior supports to challenging behavior. Each adopted program shall allow school counselors to receive at least one-third (1/3) of the hours or credit required each year through programs or courses specifically designed for school counselors.</p>

<p>Districts are authorized to utilize any means for professional development that is not prohibited by law including, but not limited to, professional development provided by the district, any state agency, institution of higher education, or any private entity.</p>

<p>F. One time per year, beginning in the 2020-2021 school year, a dyslexia awareness program shall be offered. Beginning in the 2023-2024 school year, the program shall include information and training in dysgraphia. At a minimum, the program shall include:</p>

<p>1. Training in awareness of dyslexia characteristics in students;</p>

<p>2. Training in effective classroom instruction to meet the needs of students with dyslexia; and</p>

<p>3. Available dyslexia resources for teachers, students and parents.</p>

<p>G. Except as otherwise provided for in this subsection, each certified teacher in this state shall be required by the district board of education to meet the professional development requirements established by the board, or established through the negotiation process. Except as otherwise provided for in this subsection, the professional development requirements established by each board of education shall require every teacher to annually complete a minimum number of the total number of points required to maintain employment; provided, no more than a total of one hundred fifty (150) hours of local, state, or federal professional development or training shall be required for classroom teachers during any five-year period. Failure of any teacher to meet district board of education professional development requirements may be grounds for nonrenewal of such teachers contract by the board. Such failure may also be grounds for nonconsideration of salary increments affecting the teacher. Teachers shall maintain written documentation of all their completed professional development.</p>

<p>H. Each district shall annually submit a report to the State Department of Education on the district level professional development needs, activities completed, expenditures, and results achieved for each school year by each goal as provided in subsection C of this section. If a school district elects not to adopt and offer a professional development program as provided for in subsection A of this section, the district shall not be required to submit an annual report as required pursuant to this subsection but shall report to the State Department of Education its election not to offer a program and all professional development activities completed by teachers and administrators of the school district.</p>

<p>I. Subject to the availability of funds, the Department shall develop an online system for reporting as required in subsection H of this section. The Department shall also make such information available on its website.</p>
