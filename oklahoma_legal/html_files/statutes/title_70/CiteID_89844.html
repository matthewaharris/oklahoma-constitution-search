<P>A. Unless the context clearly shows otherwise, the term "treasurer", as used 
in this section, includes a county treasurer acting as the treasurer of a school 
district pursuant to the provisions of Section 5-114 of this title. The 
treasurer so appointed shall execute, before entering upon the duties of the 
office of the treasurer, a surety bond in an amount which it is estimated by the 
board of education the treasurer will have on hand at any one time during the 
current year, and the amount of securities held as investments shall not be 
considered. The board of education is empowered to require the treasurer to 
increase or decrease the bond of the treasurer as the amount of funds on hand 
may require. Provided, the bond of a school district shall not, in any event, be 
required to be in an amount greater than that of the county treasurer of the 
county. The premium on the bond shall be paid by the board of education out of 
district funds. Provided, however, the treasurer of such district shall require 
the depository wherein school district funds are deposited to insure or 
guarantee the deposit by proper securities, which shall be of the same class of 
securities as are required to insure deposits of county treasurers of the 
various counties, and the securities shall be pledged, taken and kept in the 
manner provided by Sections 517.1 through 517.7 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</P>
<P>B. In all districts which are permitted by law to select a local treasurer, 
the county treasurer shall act as treasurer thereof until such time as a local 
treasurer shall be appointed and has executed the surety bond required by this 
section. In no instance in which the county treasurer is the treasurer of any 
school district shall any additional bond be required, but the official bond of 
the county treasurer shall stand for any and all funds and securities coming 
into the hands of the county treasurer.</P>
<P>C. The local treasurer of a district, when required by the board of 
education, shall prepare and submit in writing a report of the condition of the 
finances of the district and shall produce at any meeting of the board or to any 
committee appointed for the purpose of examining the accounts of the treasurer 
all books and papers pertaining to the office of the treasurer. Upon failure to 
make reports as provided for herein or as may otherwise be required by law, the 
board may at any regular or special meeting thereof summarily suspend the 
treasurer, and while so suspended the treasurer shall perform no act pertaining 
to the office of the treasurer. Such suspension shall continue until ended by 
order of the board or by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
<P>D. The local treasurer of a school district shall keep a separate cash ledger 
for each fund in the custody of the treasurer. The local treasurer shall enter 
each collection and disbursement in the cash ledger of the applicable fund by 
recording the date and classification of each transaction and such other 
information as may be deemed desirable. Additional ledgers shall also be 
maintained to record the investments made from each fund. Such investment 
ledgers shall disclose the date, description and principal amount paid for each 
investment purchased and the date and principal amount received for each 
investment liquidated.</P>
<P>E. Upon suspension by the board, the treasurer shall immediately turn over to 
the board of education or to the acting treasurer if one has been appointed by 
the board, all books and papers and other property pertaining to the office of 
the treasurer.</P>
<P>F. Except as otherwise provided by law, no treasurer of any district shall 
pay out school district funds in the care of the treasurer except upon warrants 
signed by the proper school district officials authorized by the law to sign 
such warrants, provided, this restriction shall not apply to sinking funds or to 
the investment of school district funds. Authorized sinking fund payments and 
payment for investments or receipt of liquidated investments may be made by 
check, wire transfer or other instrument or method through the Federal Reserve 
System.</P>
<P>G. The board of education shall, each month, set aside funds to an operating 
account and to an investment account. Investments by the treasurer shall be made 
in accordance with a written policy adopted by the board of education. The 
written investment policy shall address liquidity, diversification, safety of 
principal, yield, maturity, quality of the instrument, and capability of 
investment management. Acting within the investment policy, the treasurer shall 
place primary emphasis on safety and liquidity in the investment of funds. 
Taking into account the need to use sound investment judgment, school districts 
shall, to the extent practicable, use competitive bids when they purchase direct 
obligations of the United States Government or other obligations of the United 
States Government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Such system shall be 
designed to maximize yield within each class of investment instrument, 
consistent with the safety of the funds invested. The board of education must 
review the investment performance of the treasurer on a regular basis and no 
less than each month. The treasurer of every school district shall invest the 
full amount of the investment account in:</P>
<P>1. Direct obligations of the United States Government to the payment of which 
the full faith and credit of the Government of the United States is pledged; 
provided, a treasurer of a school district who has completed the program 
pursuant to the provisions of subsection H of this section may invest funds in 
the investment account in other obligations of the United States Government, its 
agencies or instrumentalities;</P>
<P>2. Obligations to the payment of which the full faith and credit of this 
state is pledged;</P>
<P>3. Certificates of deposits of banks when such certificates of deposits are 
secured by acceptable collateral as in the deposit of other public monies;</P>
<P>4. Savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations 
to the extent that such accounts or certificates are fully insured by the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Provided, that the income 
received from the investments may be placed in the general fund of the 
governmental subdivision to be used for general governmental operations;</P>
<P>5. Repurchase agreements that have underlying collateral consisting of those 
items specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection including obligations 
of the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities, and where the 
collateral has been deposited with a trustee or custodian bank in an irrevocable 
trust or escrow account established for such purposes;</P>
<P>6. County, municipal or school district direct debt obligations for which an 
ad valorem tax may be levied or bond and revenue anticipation notes, money 
judgments against such county, municipality or school district ordered by a 
court of record or bonds or bond and revenue anticipation notes issued by a 
public trust for which such county, municipality or school district is a 
beneficiary thereof. All collateral pledged to secure public funds shall be 
valued at no more than market value. The income received from an investment may 
be placed in the general fund of the governmental subdivision to be used for 
general governmental operations, the sinking fund, the building fund, or the 
fund from which the investment was made;</P>
<P>7. Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and which investments consist of obligations of the United States, 
its agencies and instrumentalities, and investments in those items and those 
restrictions specified in paragraphs 1 through 6 of this subsection;</P>
<P>8. Warrants, bonds or judgments of the school district; <STRIKE></P></STRIKE>
<P>9. Qualified pooled investment programs, the investments of which consist of 
those items specified in paragraphs 1 through 8 of this subsection, as well as 
obligations of the United States agencies and instrumentalities, regardless of 
the size of the districts budget. To be qualified, a pooled investment program 
for school funds must be governed through an interlocal cooperative agreement 
formed pursuant to Section 5-117b of this title, and the program must 
competitively select its investment advisors and other professionals. Any pooled 
investment program used must be approved by the board of education; or</P>
<P>10. Investment programs administered by the State Treasurer.</P>
<P>H. The board of education is hereby empowered to require the treasurer to 
satisfactorily complete an investment education program approved by the State 
Board of Education and the State Board of Career and Technology Education. Such 
program shall be designed to allow treasurers to make informed decisions 
regarding the safety, return, liquidity, costs and benefits of various 
investment options allowed under this section.</P>
<P>I. The income received on an investment may be placed in the fund from which 
the investment was made, the general fund, the building fund, or the sinking 
fund.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN><SPAN
