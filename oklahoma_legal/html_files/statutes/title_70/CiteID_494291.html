<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">C. 1. Licensure pursuant to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact shall pertain only to the initial grant of a license or certificate by the receiving state.

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">2. Each member state shall, in accordance with the rules of the Commission, define, compile, and update as necessary a list of eligible licenses and career and technical education licenses that the member state is willing to consider for equivalency pursuant to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact and provide a list to the Commission. The list shall include those licenses that a receiving state is willing to grant to teachers from other member states, pending a determination of equivalency by the receiving states licensing authority.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">3. Upon receipt of an application for licensure or certification by a teacher holding an unencumbered eligible license, the receiving state shall determine which of the receiving states eligible licenses the teacher is qualified to hold and shall grant the license(s) or certification(s) to the applicant. The determination shall be made in the sole discretion of the receiving states licensing authority and may include a determination that the applicant is not eligible for any of the receiving states eligible licenses. For all teachers who hold an unencumbered license, the receiving state shall grant one or more unencumbered licenses that, in the receiving states sole discretion, are equivalent to the license(s) held by the teacher in any other member state.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">4. For active military members and eligible military spouses who hold a license or certification that is not unencumbered, the receiving state shall grant an equivalent license or licenses that, in the receiving states sole discretion, are equivalent to the license or licenses held by the teacher in any other member state, except where the receiving state does not have an equivalent license or certification.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">5. For a teacher holding an unencumbered career and technical education license, the receiving state shall grant an unencumbered license equivalent to the career and technical education license held by the applying teacher and issued by another member state, as determined by the receiving state in its sole discretion, except where a career and technical education teacher does not hold a bachelors degree and the receiving state requires a bachelors degree for licenses to teach career and technical education. A receiving state may require career and technical education teachers to meet state industry recognized requirements, if required by law in the receiving state.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">D. 1. Except as provided for in subsection C of this section, nothing in the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact shall be construed to limit or inhibit the authority of a member state to regulate licensure or endorsements overseen by a member states licensing authority.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">2. When a teacher is required to renew a license or certification pursuant to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact, the state granting the license or certification may require the teacher to complete state specific requirements as a condition of license or certification renewal or advancement in that state.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">3. For the purposes of determining compensation, a receiving state may require additional information from teachers receiving a license or certification pursuant to the provisions of the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">4. Nothing in the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact shall be construed to limit the power of a member state to control and maintain ownership of its information pertaining to teachers or limit the application of a member states laws or regulations governing the ownership, use, or dissemination of information pertaining to teachers.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">5. Nothing in the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact shall be construed to invalidate or alter any existing agreement or another cooperative arrangement of which a member state may already be a party or limit the ability of a member state to participate in any future agreement or other cooperative arrangement to:</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">a. award teaching licenses, certification, or other benefits based on additional professional credentials including but not limited to a National Board Certification,</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">b. participate in the exchange of names of teachers whose license or certification has been subject to an adverse action by a member state, or</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">c. participate in any agreement or cooperative arrangement with a non-member state.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">E. 1. Except as provided for active military members or eligible military spouses in paragraph 4 of subsection C of this section, a teacher may only be eligible to receive a license or certification pursuant to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact where that teacher holds an unencumbered license or certification in a member state.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">2. A teacher eligible to receive a license or certification pursuant to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact shall, unless otherwise provided for herein:</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">a. upon his or her application to receive a license or certification pursuant to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact, undergo a criminal background check in the receiving state in accordance with the laws and regulations of the receiving state, and</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">b. provide the receiving state with information in addition to the information required for licensure or certification for the purposes of determining compensation, if applicable.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">F. 1. Nothing in the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact shall be deemed or construed to limit the authority of a member state to investigate or impose disciplinary measures on teachers according to the states practice laws.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">2. Member states shall be authorized to receive and shall provide files and information regarding the investigation and discipline, if any, of teachers in other member states upon request. Any member state receiving information or files shall protect and maintain the security and confidentiality thereof in at least the same manner that it maintains its own investigatory or disciplinary files and information. Prior to disclosing any disciplinary or investigatory information received from another member state, the disclosing state shall communicate its intention and purpose for disclosure to the member state which originally provided the information.</font></font></p>
