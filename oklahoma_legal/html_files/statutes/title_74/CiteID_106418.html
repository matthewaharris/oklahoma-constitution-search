<FONT face=Arial 
size=2>
<P>A. The States of Oklahoma and Texas recognize that:</P>
<P>1. There are actual and potential disputes, controversies, criminal 
proceedings, and litigation arising, or that may arise, out of the location of 
the boundary line between the states along the Red River;</P>
<P>2. The south bank of the Red River is the boundary between the states along 
the Red River; </P>
<P>3. The boundary between the states changes as a result of the natural action 
of the river and, because of those changes and the nature of the land, the south 
bank of the river is often not readily or easily identified; </P>
<P>4. While the south bank, at any given time, may be located through expensive 
and time-consuming survey techniques, such surveys can, at best, identify the 
south bank only as it exists at the time of the survey;</P>
<P>5. Locating the south bank through survey techniques is of minimal aid when 
agencies of the party states must locate the state boundary line for law 
enforcement, administrative and taxation purposes; and</P>
<P>6. The interests of the party states are better served by establishing the 
boundary between the states through use of a readily identifiable natural 
landmark than through use of an artificial survey line.</P>
<P>B. It is the principal purpose of the party states in entering into this 
compact to establish an identifiable boundary between the states of Oklahoma and 
Texas along the Red River as of the effective date of this compact without 
changing title of any person or entity, public or private, to land adjacent to 
the Red River. In addition, this compact serves the compelling purposes of:</P>
<P>1. Creation of a friendly and harmonious interstate relationship;</P>
<P>2. Avoidance of multiple exercise of sovereignty and jurisdiction, including 
matters of taxation, judicial and police powers, and exercise of administrative 
authority;</P>
<P>3. Avoidance of lack of exercise of sovereignty and jurisdiction over any 
lands along the boundary;</P>
<P>4. Avoidance of questions of venue in civil and criminal proceedings that may 
arise as a result of incidents along the boundary and avoidance or minimization 
of future disputes and litigation;</P>
<P>5. Promotion of economic and political stability; and</P>
<P>6. Placement of the boundary at a location that can be visually identified or 
located without the necessity of a current survey and that is close to the 
historical boundary location.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE II. ESTABLISHMENT OF BOUNDARY</P>
<P>A. As used in this article:</P>
<P>1. "Vegetation" means trees, shrubs, grasses, and other plant species that 
substantially cover the ground. Whether the vegetation substantially covers the 
ground is determined by reference to the density of the coverage of the ground 
by trees, shrubs, grasses, and other plant species in the area adjacent to the 
relevant portion of the riverbed; and</P>
<P>2. "Vegetation line" means the visually identifiable continuous line of 
vegetation that is adjacent to that portion of the riverbed kept practically 
bare of vegetation by the natural flow of the river and is continuous with the 
vegetation beyond the riverbed. Stray vegetation, patches of vegetation, or 
islands of vegetation within the riverbed that do not form such a line are not 
considered part of the vegetation line. Where the riverbed is entered by the 
inflow of another watercourse or is otherwise interrupted or disturbed by a 
man-made event, the line constituting the boundary is an artificial line formed 
by extending the vegetation line above and below the other watercourse or 
interrupted or disturbed area to connect and cross the watercourse or area.</P>
<P>B. The permanent political boundary line between the states of Oklahoma and 
Texas along the Red River is the vegetation line along the south bank of the Red 
River except for the Texoma area, where the boundary does not change. For 
purposes of this compact:</P>
<P>1. The Texoma area extends from the east bank of Shawnee Creek (which flows 
into the Red River from the south approximately one-half (1/2) mile below the 
Denison Dam) at its mouth to the upper end of the normal pool elevation of Lake 
Texoma (which is six hundred seventeen (617) feet); and</P>
<P>2. The upper end of the normal pool elevation of Lake Texoma is along the 
latitude of 33 degrees 54 minutes as it crosses the watercourse at the 
approximate location of longitude 96 degrees 59 minutes.</P>
<P>C. The party states agree that the existing boundary within the Texoma area 
begins at the intersection of the vegetation line on the south bank of the Red 
River with the east bank of Shawnee Creek. From this point, the boundary extends 
west along the south bank of the Red River. From Shawnee Creek to Denison Dam, 
this boundary line is within the current channel of the Red River. The boundary 
line from Shawnee Creek to the Denison Dam may be established using the Lake 
Texoma Fishing and Boating Map, No. A353, published by "FHS Maps"<SUB>TM</SUB>, 
containing acknowledgments for the data source to the United States Geological 
Survey and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, hereinafter referred to as 
"Reference Map". From the east bank of Shawnee Creek to the base of the Denison 
Dam, the boundary between the State of Oklahoma and the State of Texas may be 
the line which is depicted by the Reference Map as an extension of a black 
dashed line comprised of the following repeating characters ("-..-") east from 
the body of Lake Texoma across the depiction of the Denison Dam, thence 
continuing eastward until the line connects to a point at the intersection of 
the east bank of Shawnee Creek and the south bank of the Red River. Within Lake 
Texoma, this boundary line follows the south bank of the Red River as the bank 
was located and marked by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.</P>
<P>D. Within one (1) year after the date the United States Congress consents to 
this compact, the Commissioner of the General Land Office of Texas and a 
designated member of the Oklahoma Red River Boundary Commission, as chosen by 
the Commission, shall:</P>
<P>1. Locate the boundary line within the Texoma area as described by subsection 
C of this article, using the survey that the United States Army Corps of 
Engineers prepared in connection with the construction of Lake Texoma and any 
other surveys, historical maps, or other information that may be available;</P>
<P>2. Prepare a map of the boundary line; and</P>
<P>3. Prepare a document styled "Lake Texoma Area Boundary Agreement", which 
shall incorporate by reference and have attached as an exhibit a map of the 
boundary in the Lake Texoma area. Upon agreement, signature and acknowledgment 
by both persons, the "Lake Texoma Area Boundary Agreement" shall have the legal 
effect of establishing the boundary within the Lake Texoma area. The "Lake 
Texoma Area Boundary Agreement", when adopted pursuant to a resolution of the 
Contingency Review Board acting on behalf of the State of Oklahoma and when 
adopted pursuant to the applicable requirements of laws of the State of Texas, 
shall amend the provisions of the Red River Boundary Compact and constitute part 
of the terms of the Red River Boundary Compact. The governors of the respective 
party states shall file the "Lake Texoma Area Boundary Agreement" in the state 
library and archives of each party state and with the Oklahoma Secretary of 
State.</P>
<P>E. Within one (1) year after the date the "Lake Texoma Area Boundary 
Agreement" is filed under paragraph 3 of subsection D of this article, there 
shall be a permanently marked boundary line within the Texoma area as shown on 
the map constituting the exhibit to the "Lake Texoma Area Boundary Agreement". 
The boundary line shall be maintained with markers annually, or more frequently 
if necessary subject to any requirement or restriction of law or resulting from 
a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
<P>F. The party states may:</P>
<P>1. Agree to equally share the cost of monumenting and maintaining the lines 
demarking both the boundary within the Texoma area and the upper limit of the 
normal pool elevation in a manner designed to make the boundary readily 
identifiable to the using public; or</P>
<P>2. Seek funding from other sources for monumenting and maintaining the 
lines.</P>
<P>G. Should there be a change in the watercourse of the Red River, the party 
states recognize the rules of accretion, erosion, and avulsion. The states agree 
that accretion or erosion may cause a change in the boundary between the states 
if it causes a change in the vegetation line. With regard to avulsion, the 
states agree that a change in the course of the Red River caused by an 
immediately perceivable natural event that changes the vegetation line will 
change the location of the boundary between the states.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE III. SOVEREIGNTY</P>
<P>On the effective date of this compact, the party states agree that the State 
of Oklahoma possesses sovereignty over all lands north of the boundary line 
established by this compact and that the State of Texas possesses sovereignty 
over all lands south of the boundary line established by this compact. This 
compact does not change or affect in any manner the sovereign rights of 
federally recognized Indian tribes over tribal lands on either side of the 
boundary line established by this compact. Tribal sovereignty rights continue to 
be established and defined by controlling federal law.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE IV. PENDING LITIGATION</P>
<P>This compact does not affect the jurisdiction of any litigation concerning 
the title to any of the lands bordering the Red River pending in the courts of 
either of the party states or the United States as of the effective date of this 
compact. The states intend that such litigation, if any, continue in the trial 
and appellate courts of the jurisdiction where pending, until the litigation is 
finally determined.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE V. PUBLIC RECORDS</P>
<P>A. All public records in either party state concerning any lands the 
sovereignty over which is changed by this compact are accepted as evidence of 
record title to such lands, to and including the effective date of this compact, 
by the courts of the other state and the federal courts.</P>
<P>B. As to lands the sovereignty over which is changed by this compact, the 
recording officials of the counties of each party state shall accept for filing 
certified copies of documents of title previously filed in the other state and 
documents of title using legal descriptions derived from the land descriptions 
of the other state. The acceptance of a document for filing has no bearing on 
its legal effect or sufficiency. The legal sufficiency of a document's form, 
execution, and acknowledgments and the document's ability to convey or otherwise 
affect title, are determined by the document itself and the real estate laws of 
the jurisdiction in which the land was located at the time the document was 
executed or took effect.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE VI. TAXES</P>
<P>A. Except as provided by subsections B and C of this article, the lands the 
sovereignty over which is changed by this compact are, after the effective date 
of this compact, subject to taxation only by the state gaining sovereignty over 
the lands by this compact. </P>
<P>B. Taxes for the year of adoption of this compact for property the 
jurisdiction over which is changed by this compact may be lawfully imposed only 
by the state in which the property was located on January 1 of the year of 
adoption of this compact. The taxes for the year of adoption may be levied and 
collected by that state or its authorized governmental subdivisions or agencies, 
and any liens or other rights accrued or accruing, including the right of 
collection, are fully recognized, except that all liens or other rights arising 
out of the imposition of those taxes must be claimed or asserted within five (5) 
years after this compact takes effect or they are barred.</P>
<P>C. The party states recognize that the boundary between the states will 
change from time to time as a result of the natural actions of accretion, 
erosion, and avulsion and agree that for years subsequent to the year of 
adoption of this compact, the state within which lands adjoining the boundary 
line are located on January 1 of each year has the right to levy and collect 
taxes for the entire ensuing year.</P>
<P>D. All taxes currently assessed by governmental entities in each party state 
as to lands that border or cross the boundary line established by this compact 
are presumed to be correct as to acreage within the particular jurisdiction, 
absent competent proof to the contrary presented in writing by the property 
owner or owners to the appropriate taxing agencies. All such proof must be 
presented to the appropriate taxing agencies before May 1 of the year following 
the year in which this compact takes effect. In subsequent years it is presumed 
that the acreage taxed in each jurisdiction for the previous year was correct 
unless evidence of change is furnished to or obtained by the various taxing 
agencies under rules and regulations adopted by those taxing agencies.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE VII. PROPERTY AND WATER RIGHTS</P>
<P>This compact does not change:</P>
<P>1. The title of any person or entity, public or private, to any of the lands 
adjacent to the Red River;</P>
<P>2. The rights, including riparian rights, if any, of any person or entity, 
public or private, that exist as a result of the person's or entity's title to 
lands adjacent to the Red River; or</P>
<P>3. The boundaries of those lands.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE VIII. EFFECTIVE DATE</P>
<P>This compact takes effect when enacted by the states of Oklahoma and Texas 
and consented to by the United States Congress.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE IX. ENFORCEMENT</P>
<P>A. This compact does not limit or prevent either party state from instituting 
or maintaining any action or proceeding, legal or equitable, in any court having 
jurisdiction, for the protection of any right under this compact or the 
enforcement of any of its provisions.</P>
<P>B. This compact is not binding or obligatory on either party state unless and 
until it has been enacted by both states and consented to by the United States 
Congress. Notice of enactment of this compact by each state shall be given by 
the Governor of that state to the Governor of the other state and to the 
President of the United States. The president is requested to give notice to the 
governors of the party states of the consent to this compact by the United 
States Congress.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE X. AMENDMENTS</P>
<P>This compact remains in full force and effect unless amended in the same 
manner as it was created.</P><B><I>
