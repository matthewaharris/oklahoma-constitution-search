<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The transportation of all unlawful oil or unlawful 
gas is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and such unlawful gas or unlawful 
oil shall be forfeited to the state. Except as provided by this section and 
Section 8 of this act all vehicles being used to transport said unlawful oil or 
unlawful gas shall also be forfeited to the state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Except as authorized by subsection C of this 
section, all property taken or detained under this section by any authorized 
person shall not be repleviable, and shall be deemed to be in the custody of the 
office of the district attorney of the county in which such property was seized, 
subject only to the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If sufficient 
evidence exists, as determined by the district attorney, that any oil or gas 
seized is unlawful oil or unlawful gas or that any vehicle seized was used to 
transport such unlawful oil or unlawful gas, said district attorney shall follow 
the procedures provided in Section 8 of this act dealing with notification of 
seizure, intent and forfeiture, final disposition procedures, and release to 
innocent claimants with regard to all property seized by such authorized 
persons. If sufficient evidence does not exist, as determined by the district 
attorney, that any oil or gas seized is unlawful oil or unlawful gas or that any 
vehicle seized was used to transport such unlawful oil or unlawful gas, the 
district attorney may release such oil or gas or vehicle but shall notify any 
appropriate state or federal agency of any possible permit or license 
violations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. 1. The owner of a vehicle, upon submission of a 
written statement, under oath, to the office of the district attorney of the 
county in which said property was seized that such owner had no knowledge of the 
unlawfulness of the oil or gas or that the oil or gas became unlawful without 
his knowledge after the creation of his interest or that the vehicle was being 
used for the purpose charged without his knowledge, and upon execution of a lien 
pursuant to this subsection and entry of the lien on the certificate of title, 
shall be entitled to recover the possession of the vehicle prior to the 
commencement of the action.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The office of the district attorney of the county 
in which property was seized shall have a lien upon any vehicle seized pursuant 
to this section. If the title to the vehicle is not with the person from whom 
such vehicle was seized, the person having title shall be given notice within 
five (5) days of such seizure and of the opportunity to recover the vehicle 
pursuant to this subsection. The lien on such vehicle shall be preferred to all 
other liens or encumbrances which may attach to or upon such vehicle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The office of the district attorney claiming the 
lien within ten (10) days of seizure of the vehicle shall file in the office of 
the county clerk of the county in which such property was seized a statement 
verified by affidavit setting forth:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the registration number of the seized 
vehicle;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the name of the person having title to said 
vehicle; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. a description of the vehicle including its value. 
In addition, the office of the district attorney claiming the lien shall provide 
for the entry of the lien on the certificate of title pursuant to the Motor 
Vehicle Title Act. Such statement shall be filed and the lien recorded on the 
certificate of title prior to the recovery of the vehicle by the owner pursuant 
to this subsection.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Any person having title to the seized vehicle on 
which a lien is claimed pursuant to this subsection may at any time discharge 
the lien by depositing with the county clerk of the county in which property was 
seized a corporate surety bond made payable to the state in an amount not less 
than the value of the vehicle seized. Within three (3) business days after the 
deposit of bond is made, the county clerk shall serve upon the office of the 
district attorney claiming the lien, written notice setting forth:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the number of the lien claim;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the name of the vehicle owner;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. the property description shown on the lien 
claim;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. the names of the principal and surety; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. the bond penalty.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The party seeking to discharge the lien shall prepare 
and deliver the notice to the county clerk of the county in which the property 
was seized and pay a fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) to cover the cost of filing and 
mailing. An abbreviated notice may be used if the same refers to and encloses a 
copy of the lien claim and a copy of the bond with the clerk's filing stamp 
thereon. The notice shall be mailed by registered or certified mail at the 
option of the county clerk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If a bond is deposited, the district attorney shall 
have five (5) days after the notice is mailed within which to file a written 
objection with the county clerk of said county. If a written objection is not 
timely made, the county clerk shall immediately show the lien released of 
record. If an objection is timely made, the county clerk shall set a hearing 
within five (5) days thereafter and notify by ordinary mail both the office of 
the district attorney and the party making the deposit of the date and time 
thereof. The only grounds for objection shall be that: The surety is not 
authorized to transact business in this state; the bond is not properly signed; 
the amount is less than the value of the vehicle seized; the power of attorney 
of the surety's attorney-in-fact does not authorize the execution; there is no 
power of attorney attached if the bond is executed by anyone other than the 
surety's president and attested by its secretary; or a cease and desist order 
has been issued against the surety either by the Insurance Commissioner or a 
court of competent jurisdiction. Within two (2) business days following the 
hearing the county clerk shall either sustain or overrule the objections and 
notify the parties of his ruling by ordinary mail. If the objections are 
sustained, the ruling of the county clerk shall be conclusive for lien release 
purposes unless appealed within ten (10) days to the district court. If the 
objections are overruled, the county clerk shall immediately show the lien 
released of record.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The bond shall: Name the office of the district 
attorney in which the property was seized as obligee and the party seeking the 
release as principal; be executed by both the principal and the surety; have a 
proper power of attorney attached if executed by an attorney-in-fact; be 
executed by a corporate surety authorized to transact business in this state; 
and be conditioned that the principal and surety will pay the full amount of the 
claim as established in any appropriate court proceeding, plus any court costs, 
but in no event shall the liability of the principal or surety under the bond 
exceed the bond penalty. The conditions of any bond filed pursuant to this 
section shall be deemed to comply with the requirements hereof, regardless of 
the language or limitations set forth therein, if both the principal and surety 
intend that the bond be filed to secure a lien release under this 
section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The bond shall stand in lieu of the released lien. 
The bond shall stand liable for such principal, interest, and court costs. The 
bond principal and surety are necessary parties to an action against the 
substituted security, and by filing a bond the parties subject themselves to 
personal jurisdiction in the court where the action is properly filed and may be 
served with process as in other cases.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. If the district attorney fails to file a 
forfeiture proceeding pursuant to Section 8 of this act, upon application of the 
party filing the bond and the payment of a fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00), the 
county clerk shall appropriately note on the bond that the same has been 
released. The clerk shall not incur liability to any lien claimant for the 
release of a bond in good faith.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Upon conviction of the owner of the vehicle for 
violating the provisions of this act, the vehicle so seized upon which a lien 
has been filed pursuant to this subsection or any bond posted for the discharge 
of the lien on such vehicle shall be forfeited to the state pursuant to 
forfeiture proceedings provided by Section 8 of this act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Upon the acquittal of such person charged with 
violating the provisions of this section or upon the dismissal with prejudice of 
said charge against such person or it is shown that the owner of such vehicle 
was not knowledgable concerning the illegal use of his vehicle, the lien on the 
vehicle shall be immediately discharged in accordance with procedures for the 
discharge of liens, or the bond posted shall be returned to the person posting 
such bond.</FONT></P><B><I>
