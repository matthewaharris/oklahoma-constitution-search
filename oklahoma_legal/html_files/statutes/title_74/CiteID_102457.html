<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) When it has been determined by the Authority, 
upon application of an industrial development agency and hearing thereon in the 
manner hereinafter provided, that the establishment of a particular industrial 
development project referred to in such application has accomplished or will 
accomplish the public purposes of this act, the Authority may contract to loan 
such industrial development agency an amount not in excess of sixty-six and 
two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the cost or the estimated cost of such 
industrial development project where the loan is secured by a first mortgage on 
the industrial development project, or not in excess of thirty-three and 
one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the cost or estimated cost of such industrial 
development project where the loan is secured by a second mortgage on the 
industrial development project, as established or to be established, subject 
however to the following conditions:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(A) In case of industrial development projects to be 
established:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. the Authority shall first have determined that the 
industrial development agency holds funds which together with the commitment in 
paragraph 2 of this subsection constitute an amount equal to, or property of a 
value equal to, not less than thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of 
the estimated cost of establishing the industrial development project where the 
Authority's loan will be secured by a first mortgage on the industrial 
development project, or not less than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) 
of the estimated cost of establishing the industrial development project where 
the Authority's loan will be secured by a second mortgage on the industrial 
development project, which funds or property are available for and shall be 
applied to the establishment of such project, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. the Authority shall also have determined that the 
industrial development agency has obtained from other independent and 
responsible sources, such as banks and insurance companies or otherwise, a firm 
commitment for all other funds, over and above the loan of the Authority and 
such funds or property as the industrial development agency may hold, necessary 
for payment of all the estimated cost of establishing the industrial development 
project, and that the sum of all these funds is adequate to insure completion 
and operation of the plant or facility, or that the sum of all these funds, 
together with the machinery and equipment to be provided by the responsible 
tenant or responsible buyer, is adequate to insure completion and operation of 
the plant or facility. Provided, however, that the participation required of the 
industrial development agency referred to in paragraph 1 of this subsection, may 
in the discretion of the Authority be reduced to the extent that funds from 
independent and responsible sources under firm commitment shall, together with 
the participation of the Authority, and the participation of the 
industrialdevelopment agency, if any, constitute one hundred percent (100%) of 
the cost of establishing an industrial development project, as defined 
herein.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(B) In the case of industrial development projects 
established without initial Authority loan participation:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. the Authority shall first have determined that the 
industrial development agency has expended funds which, together with the 
commitment in paragraph 2 of this subsection, constitute an amount equal to, or 
has applied property which, together with the commitment in paragraph 2 of this 
subsection, constitutes a value equal to, not less than sixty-six and two-thirds 
percent (66 2/3%) of the cost of establishing the industrial development project 
where the Authority's loan will be secured by a first mortgage lien on the 
industrial development project, or not less than thirty-three and one-third 
percent (33 1/3%) where the Authority's loan will be secured by a second 
mortgage lien on the industrial development project, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. the Authority shall also have determined that the 
industrial development agency obtained from other independent and responsible 
sources, such as banks and insurance companies or otherwise, other funds 
necessary for payment of all the cost of establishing the industrial development 
project, and that the industrial development agency participation and these 
funds have been adequate to insure completion and operation of the plant or 
facility, or that these funds, together with the machinery and equipment 
provided by the responsible tenant or responsible buyer, have been adequate to 
insure completion and operation of the plant of facility. Provided, however, 
that the proceeds of any loan made by the Authority to the industrial 
development agency pursuant to this subsection (B) shall be used only for the 
establishment of additional industrial development projects in furtherance of 
the public purposes of this act; and provided further, that the participation 
required of the industrial development agency referred to in paragraph 1 of this 
subsection, may in the discretion of the Authority be reduced to the extent that 
funds from independent and responsible sources under firm commitment together 
with the participation of the industrial development agency, constitute 
sufficient funds to establish the industrial development project, as defined 
herein.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Any such loan of the Authority shall be for such 
period of time and shall bear interest at such rate as shall be determined by 
the Authority and shall be secured by mortgage on the industrial development 
project for which such loan was made, such mortgage to be second and subordinate 
only to the mortgage securing the first lien obligation issued to secure the 
commitment of funds from the aforesaid independent and responsible sources and 
used in the financing of the industrial development project.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Monies so loaned by the Authority to industrial 
development agencies shall be withdrawn from the Industrial Development Fund and 
paid over to the industrial development agency in such manner as shall be 
provided and prescribed by the rules and regulations of the 
Authority.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. All payments of interest on said loans and the 
principal thereof shall be deposited by the Authority without delay in the 
Industrial Development Fund.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Loans by the Authority to an industrial 
development agency for an industrial development project shall be made only in 
the manner and to the extent as in this section provided, except, however, in 
those instances wherein an agency of the federal government participates in the 
financing of an industrial development project by loan or grant, or otherwise, 
of federal funds. When any federal agency does so participate, the Authority may 
adjust the required ratios of financial participation by the industrial 
development agency, the source of independent funds, and the Authority; in such 
manner as to insure the maximum benefit available to the industrial development 
agency, the Authority, or both, by the participation of the federal agency; 
provided, however, that no such adjustment of such ratios shall cause the 
Authority to grant a loan to the industrial development agency in excess of 
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the cost or estimated cost of the 
industrial development project where such loan is secured by a first mortgage on 
the industrial development project, or thirty-three and one-third percent (33 
1/3%) of the cost or estimated cost of the industrial development project, where 
such loan is secured by a second mortgage on the industrial development 
project.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Where any federal agency participating in the 
financing of any industrial development project is not permitted to take as 
security for such participation a mortgage the lien of which is junior to the 
mortgage of the Authority, the Authority shall in such instances be hereby 
authorized to take as security for its loan to the industrial development agency 
a mortgage junior in lien to that of the federal agency.</FONT></P><B><I>
