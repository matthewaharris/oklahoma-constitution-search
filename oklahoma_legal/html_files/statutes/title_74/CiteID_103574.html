described by subsection C of this section.</P>
<P>B. The lease agreement described in subsection A of this section:</P>
<P>1. Shall allow the Greater Sand Springs Trust Authority to enter into 
agreements regarding the property described in subsection C of this section with 
third parties without the express consent of the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services, including the right of the Authority to sublease all or any

<P>2. Shall provide for the unrestricted access, use and development of the real 
property described in subsection C of this section by the Greater Sand Springs 
Trust Authority in order for the Authority to fulfill its purposes according to 
the terms of its trust indenture, including, but not limited to, the right of 
the Authority to construct capital improvements on, above or under the property 
to fulfill the purposes stated in the indenture of the Authority. The lease 
shall provide that the Authority owns and maintains capital improvements 
constructed upon the real property with the funds of the Authority;</P>
<P>3. Shall provide for the conveyance by the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services to the Greater Sand Springs Trust Authority, by quit claim 
deed or by such other instrument of conveyance as the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services and the Authority may mutually agree, for not more than a 
payment by the Authority to the Department of a nominal consideration not to 
exceed Ten Dollars ($10.00), of any parcel of real property described by the 
Authority and certified, by a majority of the trustees of the Authority, to be 
necessary for a complete development of the property described in subsection C 
of this section and necessary for the Authority to fulfill any purpose specified 
in its trust indenture. A rebuttable presumption shall exist that any conveyance 
made pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be considered to have 
been made for the general economic benefit of the residents of the beneficiary 
of the Greater Sand Springs Trust Authority and that the disposition of the 
parcel by the Authority is in furtherance of an essential governmental function 
by making a productive use of the parcel. After conveyance of a parcel of real 
property to the Authority pursuant to this paragraph, the Authority shall have 
the exclusive right to exercise all powers, rights and privileges with respect 
to the parcel as authorized by law to the owner of any real property, including, 
but not limited to, the right to sell the parcel as provided by paragraph 4 of 
this subsection;</P>
<P>4. Shall provide for the conveyance by the Authority to another legal entity,

necessary for the Authority to fulfill any purpose specified in its trust 
indenture. A rebuttable presumption shall exist that any conveyance made 
pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be considered to have been 
made for the general economic benefit of the residents of the beneficiary of the 
Greater Sand Springs Trust Authority and that the disposition of the parcel by 
the Authority is in furtherance of an essential governmental function by making 
a productive use of the parcel. If the Authority sells any part or all of the 
real property or improvements described in subsection C of this section 
subsequent to the conveyance to the Authority by the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services, the Authority shall determine the value of the real 
property sold separate and apart from the value of the improvements, if any. The 
Authority shall determine its direct and indirect costs for acquisition, 
maintenance, improvement, marketing and sale of any parcel of real property 
conveyed to a legal entity pursuant to this paragraph. The Authority shall pay 
to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services the amount of consideration 
received by the Authority from the sale of the real property in excess of the 
direct and indirect costs incurred by the Authority. The Office of Management 
and Enterprise Services shall budget all funds received from the sale of any 
parcel pursuant to this section. These funds shall be expended by the Office of 
Management and Enterprise Services for the sole purpose of additional 
maintenance or improvements for the remainder of the real property or for 
improvements at the property described in this section. Upon sale of the final 
parcel or real property and improvements pursuant to this section, the Office of 
Management and Enterprise Services shall remit the amount received and all 
remaining funds from previous sales for deposit to the credit of the Hissom 
Memorial Treatment Center Surplus Fund for appropriation pursuant to law;</P>

Authority acquires ownership of a parcel whereupon the Authority and the Office 
of Management and Enterprise Services, by mutual written agreement, shall amend 
the lease to provide for proportionately diminished maintenance expenses to be 
incurred by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services or some other legal 
entity;</P>
<P>6. Shall not require the payment of rent by the Greater Sand Springs Trust 
Authority in excess of One Dollar ($1.00) per year;</P>

Sand Springs Trust Authority to acquire any parcel of the property described by

consent to a sublease of the property described by subsection C of this section 
by the Authority to any other legal entity; and</P>
<P>9. Shall not impose the expense of maintenance or repair of the real property 
or improvements located on the property described by subsection C of this 
section upon the Greater Sand Springs Trust Authority, except as otherwise 
provided by paragraph 5 of this subsection.</P>
