<p><strong>Version 1 (Amended by Laws 2024, HB 1805, c. 139, § 2, eff. November 1, 2024)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>A. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and as provided for elected officials in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=102505">Section 913.4</a> of this title, any member who shall retire on or after the member's normal retirement date shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two percent (2%) of the member's final average compensation as determined pursuant to paragraph (18) of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440158">Section 902</a> of this title, multiplied by the number of years of credited service that has been credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439637">Section 913</a> of this title other than years credited pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p>(2) Effective January 1, 2004, except as otherwise provided for elected officials in Section 913.4 of this title and except for those members making contributions pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title, any member who shall retire shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the member's final average compensation as determined pursuant to paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of full years of participating service after January 1, 2004, that have been credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title and only for those full years of participating service for which contributions have been made pursuant to paragraph (g) of subsection (1) of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440160">Section 919.1</a> of this title. The two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) multiplier shall not apply to purchased service, purchased or granted military service or transferred service. In order to receive the two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) multiplier in computing retirement benefits, an active member shall make an irrevocable written election to pay the contributions pursuant to paragraph (g) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title. The two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) multiplier pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply to additional years of service credit attributed to sick leave pursuant to paragraph 7 of subsection B of Section 913 of this title and fractional years pursuant to subsection C of Section 913 of this title and shall be attributable only to the participating service credited after the election of the member.</p>

<p>(3) The minimum final average compensation for any person who becomes a member of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System on or after July 1, 1995, and who had:</p>

<p>a. twenty (20) or more years of credited service within the System as of the member's retirement date shall be no less than Thirteen Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($13,800.00) per annum,</p>

<p>b. at least fifteen (15) but not more than nineteen (19) years of credited service within the System as of the member's retirement date shall be no less than Six Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($6,900.00) per annum, or</p>

<p>c. less than fifteen (15) years of credited service within the System as of the member's retirement date shall not be eligible for any minimum amount of final average compensation and the member's final average compensation shall be the final average compensation as defined by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title.</p>

<p>(4) Provided, further, any member who has elected a vested benefit pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440083">Section 917</a> of this title shall be entitled to receive benefits as outlined in this section except the percent factor and the member's maximum compensation level in effect the date the member's employment was terminated with a participating employer shall be applicable.</p>

<p>(5) Any member who is a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer employed by the Department of Corrections at the time of retirement and who retires on or before June 30, 2000, shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation of the member not to exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and two percent (2%) of the final average salary in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (9) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of service as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer; provided, any years accrued prior to July 1, 1990, as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer by a member who is employed as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer on July 1, 1990, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two and one-quarter percent (2 1/4%) of the final average compensation of the member not to exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and two percent (2%) of the final average salary in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (9) of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440158">Section 902</a> of this title, multiplied by the number of years of such service and any years in excess of twenty (20) years as such an officer or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service. Any person who contributes to the System as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title, on or before June 30, 2000, but who does not make such contributions after June 30, 2000, and who does not qualify for normal retirement under subparagraph (c) of paragraph (24) of Section 902 of this title shall have retirement benefits for each year of full-time-equivalent participating service as a correctional or a probation and parole officer after July 1, 1990, computed on two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation based upon those years as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer. Provided, further, any fugitive apprehension agent shall be entitled to receive benefits as outlined in Section 901 et seq. of this title for service as a fugitive apprehension agent prior to July 1, 2002, only upon payment to the System of the employee contributions which would have been paid if such fugitive apprehension agent had been covered by this section prior to July 1, 2002, plus interest of not to exceed ten percent (10%) as determined by the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement Board of Trustees. The Department of Corrections may make the employee contribution and interest payment on behalf of such member.</p>

<p>(6) Any member who is a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent employed by the Department of Corrections at the time of retirement and who retires on or after July 1, 2002, shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation of the member, but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of service as a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent, and any years in excess of twenty (20) years as such an officer or agent, or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service. For purposes of this paragraph, "final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, for the highest three (3) years of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment for all years of service performed by such member, both for years of service performed as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer or fugitive apprehension agent, not in excess of twenty (20) years, and for years of service performed in excess of twenty (20) years, whether as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer, fugitive apprehension agent or other position unless the computation of benefits would result in a lower retirement benefit amount than if final average compensation were to be computed as otherwise provided by this paragraph. Final average compensation shall be determined by computing the average annual salary for the highest five (5) of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment, with respect to members whose first participating service occurs on or after July 1, 2013.</p>

<p>(7) Any member who is a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent who has at least five (5) years of service as a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent who is in such position on June 30, 2004, or who is hired after June 30, 2004, in such position, and who receives a promotion or change in job classification after June 30, 2004, to another position in the Department of Corrections, and who is employed by the Department of Corrections at the time of retirement and who retires on or after July 1, 2004, shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation of the member, but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of service with the Department of Corrections and any years in excess of twenty (20) years with the Department or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service. For purposes of this paragraph, "final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, for the highest three (3) years of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment for all years of service performed by such member with the Department.

For purposes of this paragraph, "final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, for the highest three (3) years of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment for all years of service performed by such member, both for years of service performed as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer or fugitive apprehension agent, or years of service performed as a Grand River Dam public safety officer, not in excess of twenty (20) years, and for years of service performed in excess of twenty (20) years, whether as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer, fugitive apprehension agent, Grand River Dam public safety officer, or other position unless the computation of benefits would result in a lower retirement benefit amount than if final average compensation were to be computed as otherwise provided by this paragraph. Final average compensation shall be determined by computing the average annual salary for the highest five (5) of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment, with respect to members whose first participating service occurs on or after July 1, 2013, or with respect to Grand River Dam public safety officers whose first participating service occurs on or after July 1, 2016.</p>

Retirement benefits shall be calculated based upon the two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) multiplier upon payment being made pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=102506">Section 913.5</a> of this title.</p>

<p>(10) Any person who contributes to the System as a deputy sheriff or county jailer as provided in paragraph (f) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title, and who retires under normal retirement or early retirement under division (v) of subparagraph (d) of paragraph (24) of Section 902 of this title, shall have retirement benefits for each year of full-time-equivalent participating service as a deputy sheriff or county jailer computed on two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation based upon those years as a deputy sheriff or county jailer, and any years in excess of twenty (20) years as a deputy sheriff or county jailer, or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439637">Section 913</a> of this title, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service. For purposes of this paragraph, "final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, both for years of service performed as a deputy sheriff or county jailer not in excess of twenty (20) years, and for years of service performed in excess of twenty (20) years, whether as a deputy sheriff or county jailer.</p>

<p>(11) Any person who contributes to the System as an emergency medical service personnel as provided in paragraph (h) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title, and who retires under normal retirement or early retirement under division (vii) of subparagraph (d) of paragraph (24) of Section 902 of this title, shall have retirement benefits for each year of full-time-equivalent participating service as an emergency medical service personnel computed on two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation based upon those years as an emergency medical service personnel. Any years of full-time-equivalent participating service in excess of twenty (20) years as an emergency medical personnel, or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service.

<p>(12) Upon death of a retiree, there shall be paid to his or her beneficiary an amount equal to the excess, if any, of his or her accumulated contributions over the sum of all retirement benefit payments made.</p>

<p>(13) Such annual retirement benefits shall be paid in equal monthly installments, except that the Board may provide for the payment of retirement benefits which total less than Two Hundred Forty Dollars ($240.00) a year on other than a monthly basis.</p>

<p>(14) Pursuant to the rules established by the Board, a retiree receiving monthly benefits from the System may authorize warrant deductions for any products currently offered to active state employees through the Oklahoma Employees Insurance and Benefits Board, provided that product is offered to state retirees as a group and has a minimum participation of five hundred state retirees. The System has no responsibility for the marketing, enrolling or administration of such products, but shall retain a processing fee of two percent (2%) of the gross deductions for the products. Retirement benefit deductions shall be made for membership dues for any statewide association for which payroll deductions are authorized pursuant to subsection B of Section 34.70 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma Statutes for retired members of any state-supported retirement system, upon proper authorization given by the member to the board from which the member or beneficiary is currently receiving retirement benefits.</p>

<p>B. A member shall be considered disabled if such member qualifies for the payment of Social Security disability benefits, or the payment of benefits pursuant to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, Section 231 et seq. of Title 45 of the United States Code, and shall be eligible for benefits hereunder upon proof of such disability, provided such member is an active regularly scheduled employee with a participating employer at the time of injury or inception of illness or disease resulting in subsequent certification of eligibility for Social Security disability benefits by reason of such injury, illness or disease, providing such disability is certified by the Social Security Administration within one (1) year after the last date physically on the job and after completion of at least eight (8) years of participating service or combined prior and participating service or resulting in subsequent certification of eligibility of disability by the Railroad Retirement Board providing such certification is made by the Railroad Retirement Board within one (1) year after the last date physically on the job and after completion of at least eight (8) years of participating service or combined prior and participating service. The member shall submit to the System the Social Security Award Notice or the Railroad Retirement Award Notice certifying the date of entitlement for disability benefits, as issued by the Social Security Administration, Department of Health and Human Services or the Railroad Retirement Board. Disability benefits shall become effective on the date of entitlement as established by the Social Security Administration or the Railroad Retirement Board, but not before the first day of the month following removal from the payroll, whichever is later, and final approval by the System. Benefits shall be based upon length of service and compensation as of the date of disability, without actuarial reduction because of commencement prior to the normal retirement date. The only optional form of benefit payment available for disability benefits is Option A as provided for in Section 918 of this title.

<hr />
<p>A. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and as provided for elected officials in Section 913.4 of this title, any member who shall retire on or after the member's normal retirement date shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two percent (2%) of the member's final average compensation as determined pursuant to paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of credited service that has been credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title other than years credited pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p>(2) Effective January 1, 2004, except as otherwise provided for elected officials in Section 913.4 of this title and except for those members making contributions pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title, any member who shall retire shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the member's final average compensation as determined pursuant to paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of full years of participating service after January 1, 2004, that have been credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title and only for those full years of participating service for which contributions have been made pursuant to paragraph (g) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title. The two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) multiplier shall not apply to purchased service, purchased or granted military service or transferred service. In order to receive the two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) multiplier in computing retirement benefits, an active member shall make an irrevocable written election to pay the contributions pursuant to paragraph (g) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title. The two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) multiplier pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply to additional years of service credit attributed to sick leave pursuant to paragraph 7 of subsection B of Section 913 of this title and fractional years pursuant to subsection C of Section 913 of this title and shall be attributable only to the participating service credited after the election of the member.</p>

<p>(3) The minimum final average compensation for any person who becomes a member of the System on or after July 1, 1995:</p>

<p>a. and who had twenty (20) or more years of credited service within the System as of the member's retirement date shall be no less than Thirteen Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($13,800.00) per annum,</p>

<p>(4) Provided, further, any member who has elected a vested benefit pursuant to Section 917 of this title shall be entitled to receive benefits as outlined in this section except the percent factor and the member's maximum compensation level in effect the date the member's employment was terminated with a participating employer shall be applicable.</p>

<p>(5) Any member who is a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer employed by the Department of Corrections at the time of retirement and who retires on or before June 30, 2000, shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation of the member not to exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and two percent (2%) of the final average salary in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (9) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of service as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer; provided, any years accrued prior to July 1, 1990, as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer by a member who is employed as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer on July 1, 1990, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two and one-quarter percent (2 1/4%) of the final average compensation of the member not to exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and two percent (2%) of the final average salary in excess of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (9) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of such service and any years in excess of twenty (20) years as such an officer or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service. Any person who contributes to the System as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title, on or before June 30, 2000, but who does not make such contributions after June 30, 2000, and who does not qualify for normal retirement under subparagraph (c) of paragraph (24) of Section 902 of this title shall have retirement benefits for each year of full-time-equivalent participating service as a correctional or a probation and parole officer after July 1, 1990, computed on two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation based upon those years as a correctional officer or a probation and parole officer. Provided, further, any fugitive apprehension agent shall be entitled to receive benefits as outlined in this act for service as a fugitive apprehension agent prior to July 1, 2002, only upon payment to the System of the employee contributions which would have been paid if such fugitive apprehension agent had been covered by this section prior to the effective date of this act, plus interest of not to exceed ten percent (10%) as determined by the Board. The Department of Corrections may make the employee contribution and interest payment on behalf of such member.</p>

<p>(6) Any member who is a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent employed by the Department of Corrections at the time of retirement and who retires on or after July 1, 2002, shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation of the member, but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of service as a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent, and any years in excess of twenty (20) years as such an officer or agent, or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service. For purposes of this paragraph, "final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, for the highest three (3) years of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment for all years of service performed by such member, both for years of service performed as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer or fugitive apprehension agent, not in excess of twenty (20) years, and for years of service performed in excess of twenty (20) years, whether as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer, fugitive apprehension agent or other position unless the computation of benefits would result in a lower retirement benefit amount than if final average compensation were to be computed as otherwise provided by this paragraph. "Final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary for the highest five (5) of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment, with respect to members whose first participating service occurs on or after July 1, 2013.</p>

<p>(7) Any member who is a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent who has at least five (5) years of service as a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent who is in such position on June 30, 2004, or who is hired after June 30, 2004, in such position, and who receives a promotion or change in job classification after June 30, 2004, to another position in the Department of Corrections, and who is employed by the Department of Corrections at the time of retirement and who retires on or after July 1, 2004, shall be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation of the member, but not exceeding the maximum compensation level as provided in paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, multiplied by the number of years of service with the Department of Corrections and any years in excess of twenty (20) years with the Department or years credited to the member in accordance with the provisions of Section 913 of this title, shall be calculated for retirement purposes at two percent (2%) of the final average compensation of the member multiplied by the number of years of such service. For purposes of this paragraph, "final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, for the highest three (3) years of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment for all years of service performed by such member with the Department. "Final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary for the highest five (5) of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment, with respect to members whose first participating service occurs on or after July 1, 2013.</p>

<p>(8) Any person who contributed to the System as a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of Section 919.1 of this title, and who retires under normal retirement or early retirement on or after January 1, 2004, under paragraph (24) of Section 902 of this title, and any public safety officer described by paragraph (37) of Section 902 of this title hired on or after the effective date of this act by the Grand River Dam Authority and who retires on or after the effective date of this act, shall have retirement benefits for each year of full-time-equivalent participating service as a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer or a fugitive apprehension agent, or Grand River Dam public safety officer computed on two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the final average compensation based upon those years as a correctional officer, a probation and parole officer, a fugitive apprehension agent or a Grand River Dam public safety officer. For purposes of this paragraph, "final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (18) of Section 902 of this title, for the highest three (3) years of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment for all years of service performed by such member, both for years of service performed as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer or fugitive apprehension agent, or years of service performed as a Grand River Dam public safety officer, not in excess of twenty (20) years, and for years of service performed in excess of twenty (20) years, whether as a correctional officer, probation and parole officer, fugitive apprehension agent, Grand River Dam public safety officer, or other position unless the computation of benefits would result in a lower retirement benefit amount than if final average compensation were to be computed as otherwise provided by this paragraph. "Final average compensation" shall be determined by computing the average annual salary for the highest five (5) of the last ten (10) years of participating service immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment, with respect to members whose first participating service occurs on or after July 1, 2013, or with respect to Grand River Dam public safety officers whose first participating service occurs on or after the effective date of this act.</p>

<p>c.

Disability benefits shall become effective on the date of entitlement as established by the Social Security Administration or the Railroad Retirement Board, but not before the first day of the month following removal from the payroll, whichever is later, and final approval by the Retirement System. Benefits shall be based upon length of service and compensation as of the date of disability, without actuarial reduction because of commencement prior to the normal retirement date. The only optional form of benefit payment available for disability benefits is Option A as provided for in Section 918 of this title. Option A must be elected in accordance with the provisions of Section 918 of this title. Benefit payments shall cease upon the member's recovery from disability prior to the normal retirement date. Future benefits, if any, shall be paid based upon length of service and compensation as of the date of disability. In the event that disability ceases and the member returns to employment within the System credited service to the date of disability shall be restored, and future benefits shall be determined accordingly.</p>

<p>C.
