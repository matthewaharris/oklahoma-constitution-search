<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Southern States Energy Compact is hereby entered 
into by this state with any and all other states legally joining therein in 
accordance with its terms, in the form substantially as follows:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE I. POLICY AND PURPOSE</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The party states recognize that the proper employment 
and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, 
materials, and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the 
environment, can assist substantially in the industrialization of the South and 
the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that 
optimum benefit from and acquisition of energy resources and facilities require 
systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a 
cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such 
cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this Compact to provide 
the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the 
economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being 
of the region's people.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE II. THE BOARD</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) There is hereby created an agency of the party 
states to be known as the "Southern States Energy Board", hereinafter called the 
Board. The Board shall be composed of three (3) members from each party state, 
one of whom shall be appointed or designated in each state to represent the 
Governor, the State Senate and the State House of Representatives, respectively. 
Each member shall be designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the 
state which he represents and serving and subject to removal in accordance with 
such law. Any member of the Board may provide for the discharge of his duties 
and the performance of his functions thereon, either for the duration of his 
membership or for any lesser period of time, by a deputy or assistant, if the 
laws of his state make specific provision therefor. The federal government may 
be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such 
representation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Each party state shall each be entitled to one 
vote on the Board to be determined by majority vote of each member or member's 
representative from the party state present and voting on any question. No 
action of the Board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a 
majority of all party states are represented and unless a majority of the total 
number of votes on the Board are cast in favor thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The Board shall have a seal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The Board shall elect annually, from among its 
members, a chairman, a vice-chairman, and a treasurer. The Board shall appoint 
an Executive Director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as 
Secretary, and who, together with the treasurer, shall be bonded in such amounts 
as the Board may require.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) The Executive Director, with the approval of the 
Board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary 
for the performance of the Board's functions irrespective of the civil service, 
personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(f) The Board may establish and maintain, 
independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, a 
suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the Board 
shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and 
survivors insurance provided that the Board takes such steps as may be necessary 
pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a 
governmental agency or unit. The Board may establish and maintain or participate 
in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be 
appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(g) The Board may borrow, accept, or contract for the 
services of personnel from any state or the United States or any subdivision or 
agency thereof, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, 
firm or corporation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(h) The Board may accept for any of its purposes and 
functions under this Compact any and all donations, and grants of money, 
equipment, supplies, materials, and services, conditional or otherwise, from any 
state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate 
agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and may receive, 
utilize and dispose of the same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(i) The Board may establish and maintain such 
facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The Board 
may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest 
therein.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(j) The Board shall adopt bylaws, rules and 
regulations for the conduct of its business, and shall have the power to amend 
and rescind these bylaws, rules, and regulations. The Board shall publish its 
bylaws, rules, and regulations in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof, 
and shall also file a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency 
or officer in each of the party states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(k) The Board annually shall make, to the governor of 
each party state, a report covering the activities of the Board for the 
preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by 
the Board, which report shall be transmitted to the Legislature of said state. 
The Board may issue such additional reports as it may deem desirable.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE III. FINANCES</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The Board shall submit to the executive head or 
designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated 
expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction 
for presentation to the Legislature thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Each of the Board's budgets of estimated 
expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to 
be appropriated by each of the party states. One-half (1/2) of the total amount 
of each budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned among the party 
states in equal shares; one-quarter (1/4) of each such budget shall be 
apportioned among the party states in accordance with the ratio of their 
populations to the total population of the entire group of party states based on 
the last Decennial Federal Census; and one-quarter (1/4) of each such budget 
shall be apportioned among the party states on the basis of the relative average 
per capita income of the inhabitants in each of the party states based on the 
latest computations published by the federal census-taking agency. Subject to 
appropriation by their respective Legislatures, the Board shall be provided with 
such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of 
establishing and maintaining facilities, a staff of personnel, and such 
activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and 
entrusted to the Board.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The Board may meet any of its obligations in 
whole or in part with funds available to it under Article II (h) of this 
Compact, provided that the Board takes specific action setting aside such funds 
prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this 
manner. Except where the Board makes use of funds available to it under Article 
II (h) hereof, the Board shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment 
of funds by the party jurisdictions adequate to meet the same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The Board shall keep accurate accounts of all 
receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Board shall be 
subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. 
However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Board shall be 
audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit 
shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the 
Board.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) The accounts of the Board shall be open at any 
reasonable time for inspection.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IV. ADVISORY 
COMMITTEES</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Board may establish such advisory and technical 
committees as it may deem necessary, membership on which to include but not be 
limited to private citizens, expert and lay personnel, representatives of 
industry, labor, commerce, agriculture, civic associations, medicine, education, 
voluntary health agencies, and officials of local, state and federal government, 
and may cooperate with and use the services of any such committees and the 
organizations which they represent in furthering any of its activities under 
this Compact.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE V. POWERS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Board shall have power to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Ascertain and analyze on a continuing basis the 
position of the South with respect to energy, energy-related industries and

additions to, the laws, codes, rules, regulations, administrative procedures and 
practices or ordinances of the party states in any of the fields of its interest

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(l) Ascertain from time to time such methods, 
practices, circumstances, and conditions as may bring about the prevention and 
control of energy and environmental incidents in the area comprising the party 
states, to coordinate the environmental and other energy-related incident 
prevention and control plans and the work relating thereto of the appropriate 
agencies of the party states and to facilitate the rendering of aid by the party 
states to each other in coping with energy and environmental incidents. The 
Board may formulate and, in accordance with need from time to time, revise a 
regional plan or regional plans for coping with energy and environmental 
incidents within the territory of the party states as a whole or within any 
subregion or subregions of the geographic area covered by this 
Compact.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VI. SUPPLEMENTARY 
AGREEMENTS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) To the extent that the Board has not undertaken 
an activity or project which would be within its power under the provisions of 
Article V of this Compact, any two or more of the party states, acting by their 
duly constituted administrative officials, may enter into supplementary 
agreements for the undertaking and continuance of such an activity or project. 
Any such agreement shall specify its purpose or purposes; its duration and the 
procedure for termination thereof or withdrawal therefrom; the method of 
financing and allocating the costs of the activity or project; and such other 
matters as may be necessary or appropriate. No such supplementary agreement 
entered into pursuant to this article shall become effective prior to its 
submission to and approval by the Board. The Board shall give such approval 
unless it finds that the supplementary agreement or the activity or project 
contemplated thereby is inconsistent with the provisions of this Compact or a 
program or activity conducted by or participated in by the Board.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Unless all of the party states participate in a 
supplementary agreement, any cost or costs thereof shall be borne separately by 
the states party thereto. However, the Board may administer or otherwise assist

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) No party to a supplementary agreement entered 
into pursuant to this article shall be relieved thereby of any obligation or 
duty assumed by said party state under or pursuant to this Compact, except that 
timely and proper performance of such obligation or duty by means of the 
supplementary agreement may be offered as performance pursuant to the 
Compact.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VII. OTHER LAWS AND 
RELATIONSHIPS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nothing in this Compact shall be construed 
to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Permit or require any person or other entity to 
avoid or refuse compliance with any law, rule, regulation, order or ordinance of 
a party state or subdivision thereof now or hereafter made, enacted or in 
force.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Limit, diminish, or otherwise impair jurisdiction 
exercised by the United States Department of Energy, any agency successor 
thereto, or any other federal department, agency or officer pursuant to and in 
conformity with any valid and operative act of Congress.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Alter the relations between the respective 
internal responsibilities of the government of a party state and its

ENTRY<BR>INTO FORCE AND WITHDRAWAL</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Any or all of the states of Alabama, Arkansas, 
Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, 
Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, 
West Virginia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin 
Islands shall be eligible to become party to this Compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) As to any eligible party state, this Compact 
shall become effective when its Legislature shall have enacted the same into 
law; provided that it shall not become initially effective until enacted into 
law by seven states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by 
enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall become 
effective until the Governor of the withdrawing state shall have sent formal 
notice in writing to the Governor of each other party state informing said 
Governors of the action of the Legislature in repealing the Compact and 
declaring an intention to withdraw.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IX. SEVERABILITY AND 
CONSTRUCTION</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The provisions of this Compact and of any 
supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be severable and if any 
phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact or such supplementary 
agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating 
state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, 
agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder 
of this Compact or such supplementary agreement and the applicability thereof to 
any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If 
this Compact or any supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be held 
contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the Compact or 
such supplementary agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the 
remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all 
severable matters. The provisions of this Compact and of any supplementary 
agreement entered into pursuant hereto shall be liberally construed to 
effectuate the purpose thereof.</FONT></P><B><I>
