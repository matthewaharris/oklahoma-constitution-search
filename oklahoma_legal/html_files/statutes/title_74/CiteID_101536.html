<p>7. &nbsp;The cost of the audit shall be borne by the public entity audited. &nbsp;Upon notification by the State Auditor and Inspector of receipt of the petition, certified by the county election board as having the required number of signatures, the public entity shall encumber funds in an amount specified by the State Auditor and Inspector, which shall be within the range of anticipated cost stated on the petition from any funds not otherwise specifically appropriated or allocated. &nbsp;Payment for the audit from such encumbered funds shall be made as work progresses, and final payment shall be made on or before its publication.</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;The names of the signers of any petition shall be confidential and neither the State Auditor and Inspector, the county election board nor the county treasurer may release them to any other person or entity except upon an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
