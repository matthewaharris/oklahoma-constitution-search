<p>A. The Governor's Council for Workforce and Economic Development established under the authority of Executive Order 2005-27 is hereby recognized by the Legislature as the State's Workforce Investment Board. The Council succeeded and was established in lieu of the Oklahoma Workforce Investment Board. Appointed members of the Council serving under the authority of Executive Order 2005-27 when this act becomes effective shall continue to serve until their terms have expired and their successors have been duly appointed.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the purpose of the Council shall be to:</p>

<p>1. Guide the development of a comprehensive and coordinated workforce development system for the state and monitor its operation; and</p>

<p>2. Review and make recommendations that will align the workforce system, including education, with the economic development goals of the state for the purpose of creating workforce and economic development systems that are integrated and shall provide Oklahoma a competitive advantage in a global economy.</p>

<p>B. Membership of the Council shall include representatives of private employers who reflect Oklahoma's projected and desired business and industry base and public officials from agencies which provide programs and services related to workforce, education and economic development. All Council members shall be in positions to influence policy and hiring decisions within their organizations. Initial appointments to the Council shall conform to the following described schedule:</p>

<p>1. The membership of the Council shall comply with the federal requirements of the state investment board;</p>

Private members may be removed from office for failure to attend three consecutive Council meetings. The chair of the Council shall be from the private sector and shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Governor.</p>

<p>D. The Council shall meet at such times and places as it deems appropriate. Members shall serve without compensation.
