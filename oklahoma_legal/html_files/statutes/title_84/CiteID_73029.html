<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Prior to July 1, 1985, if any person having title 
to any estate not otherwise limited by marriage contract, dies without disposing 
of the estate by will, it descends and must be distributed in the following 
manner:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>First. If the decedent leave a surviving husband or 
wife, and only one child, or the lawful issue of one child, in equal shares to 
the surviving husband, or wife and child, or issue of such child. If the 
decedent leave a surviving husband or wife, and more than one child living, or 
one child living and the lawful issue of one or more deceased children, 
one-third (1/3) to the surviving husband or wife, and the remainder in equal 
shares to his children, and to the lawful issue of any deceased child, by right 
of representation; but if there be no child of the decedent living at his death, 
the remainder goes to all of his lineal descendants; and if all the descendants 
are in the same degree of kindred to the decedent they share equally, otherwise 
they take according to the right of representation: Provided, that if the 
decedent shall have been married more than once, the spouse at the time of death 
shall inherit of the property not acquired during coverture with such spouse 
only an equal part with each of the living children of decedent, and the lawful 
issue of any deceased child by right of representation. If the decedent leave no 
surviving husband or wife, but leaves issue, the whole estate goes to such 
issue, and if such issue consists of more than one child living or one child 
living, and the lawful issue of one or more deceased children, then the estate 
goes in equal shares to the children living, or to the child living, and the 
issue of the deceased child or children by right of representation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Second. If the decedent leave no issue, the estate 
goes one-half (1/2) to the surviving husband or wife, and the remaining one-half 
(1/2) to the decedent's father or mother, or, if he leave both father and 
mother, to them in equal shares; but if there be no father or mother, then said 
remaining one-half (1/2) goes, in equal shares, to the brothers and sisters of 
the decedent, and to the children of any deceased brother or sister, by right of 
representation. If decedent leave no issue, nor husband nor wife, the estate 
must go to the father or mother, or if he leave both father and mother, to them 
in equal shares: Provided, that in all cases where the property is acquired by 
the joint industry of husband and wife during coverture, and there is no issue, 
the whole estate shall go to the survivor, at whose death, if any of the said 
property remain, one-half (1/2) of such property shall go to the heirs of the 
husband and one-half (1/2) to the heirs of the wife, according to the right of 
representation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Third. If there be no issue, nor husband nor wife, 
nor father, nor mother, then in equal shares to the brothers and sisters of the 
decedent, and to the children of any deceased brother or sister, by right of 
representation; if the deceased, being a minor, leave no issue, the estate must 
go to the parents equally, if living together, if not living together, to the 
parent having had the care of said deceased minor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Fourth. If the decedent leave no issue nor husband, 
nor wife, nor father and no brother or sister is living at the time of his 
death, the estate goes to his mother to the exclusion of the issue, if any, of 
deceased brothers or sisters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Fifth. If the decedent leave a surviving husband or 
wife, and no issue, and no father, nor mother, nor brother, nor sister, the 
whole estate goes to the surviving husband or wife.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sixth. If the decedent leave no issue, nor husband, 
nor wife, and no father or mother, or brother, or sister, the estate must go to 
the next of kin in equal degree, excepting that when there are two or more 
collateral kindred, in equal degree, but claiming through different ancestors, 
those who claimed through the nearest ancestors must be preferred to those 
claiming through an ancestor more remote.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Seventh. If the decedent leave several children, or 
one child and the issue of one or more children, and any such surviving child 
dies under age, and not having been married, all the estate that came to the 
deceased child by inheritance from such decedent, descends in equal shares to 
the other children of the same parent, and to the issue of any such other 
children who are dead, by right of representation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Eighth. If, at the death of such child who dies under 
age, not having been married, all the other children of his parents are also 
dead, and any of them have left issue, the estate that came to such child by 
inheritance from his parent descends to the issue of all other children of the 
same parent; and if all the issue are in the same degree of kindred to the 
child, they share the estate equally, otherwise, they take according to the 
right of representation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Ninth. If the decedent leave no husband, wife, or 
kindred, the estate escheats to the state for the support of common 
schools.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Beginning July 1, 1985, if any person having title 
to any estate not otherwise limited by any antenuptial marriage contract dies 
without disposing of the estate by will, such estate descends and shall be 
distributed in the following manner:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. If the decedent leaves a surviving spouse, the 
share of the estate passing to said spouse is:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. if there is no surviving issue, parent, brother or 
sister, the entire estate, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. if there is no surviving issue but the decedent is 
survived by a parent or parents, brother or sister:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) all the property acquired by the joint industry 
of the husband and wife during coverture, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) an undivided one-third (1/3) interest in the 
remaining estate, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. if there are surviving issue, all of whom are also 
issue of the surviving spouse: an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in all the 
property of the estate whether acquired by the joint industry of the husband and 
wife during coverture or otherwise, or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. if there are surviving issue, one or more of whom 
are not also issue of the surviving spouse:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in the 
property acquired by the joint industry of the husband and wife during 
coverture, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) an undivided equal part in the property of the 
decedent not acquired by the joint industry of the husband and wife during 
coverture with each of the living children of the decedent and the lawful issue 
of any deceased child by right of representation;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The share of the estate not passing to the 
surviving spouse or if there is no surviving spouse, the estate is to be 
distributed as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. in undivided equal shares to the surviving 
children of the decedent and issue of any deceased child of the decedent by 
right of representation, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. if there is no surviving issue, to the surviving 
parent or parents of the decedent in undivided equal shares, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. if there is no surviving issue nor parent, in 
undivided equal shares to the issue of parents by right of representation, 
or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. if there is no surviving issue, parent, nor issue 
of parents, but the decedent is survived by one or more grandparents or issue of 
any grandparent, half of the estate passes equally to the paternal grandparents 
if both survive, or to the surviving paternal grandparent, or to the issue of 
any paternal grandparent if both paternal grandparents are deceased, the issue 
taking equally if they are all of the same degree of kinship to the decedent, 
but if of unequal degree those of more remote degree take by representation and 
the other half passes to the maternal relatives in the same manner; but if the 
decedent is survived by one or more grandparents or issue of grandparents on 
only one side of the family, paternal or maternal, the entire estate shall pass 
to such survivors in the manner set forth in this subsection, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. if there is no surviving issue, parent, issue of 
parents, grandparent, nor issue of a grandparent, the estate passes to the next 
of kin in equal degree;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If the decedent leaves no spouse, issue, parent, 
issue of parents, grandparent, issue of a grandparent, nor kindred, then the 
estate shall escheat to the state for the support of the common schools; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. For the purpose of this section, the phrase "by 
right of representation" means the estate is to be divided into as many equal 
shares as there are surviving heirs in the nearest degree of kinship and 
deceased persons in the same degree who left issue who survive the decedent, 
each surviving heir in the nearest degree receiving one equal share and the 
equal share of each deceased person in the same degree being divided among his 
issue in the same manner. The word "issue" means lineal 
descendants.</FONT></P><B><I>
