</div>
<p>Exempt from this act are the following:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;A person engaging in commercial telephone solicitation where the solicitation is an isolated transaction and not conducted in the course of a pattern of repeated transactions of like nature;</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;A person soliciting for religious, charitable, political, or educational purposes. &nbsp;A person soliciting for other noncommercial purposes is exempt only if that person is soliciting for a nonprofit organization and if that organization is properly registered as such with the Secretary of State and is included within the exemption of Section 501(c)(3) or (6) of the Internal Revenue Code;</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;A person who does not make the major sales presentation during the telephone solicitation and who does not intend to, and does not actually, complete or obtain provisional acceptance of a sale during the telephone solicitation, but who makes the major sales presentation and completes the sale at a later face-to-face meeting between the seller and the prospective purchaser. &nbsp;However, if a seller, directly following a telephone solicitation, causes an individual whose primary purpose is to go to the prospective purchaser to collect the payment or deliver any item purchased, this exemption does not apply;</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;A licensed securities, commodities, or investment broker, dealer, or investment adviser when soliciting within the scope of his or her license, or a licensed associated person of a securities, commodities, or investment broker, dealer, or investment adviser when soliciting within the scope of his or her license. &nbsp;As used in this section, "licensed securities, commodities, or investment broker, dealer, or investment adviser" means a person subject to license or registration by the Securities and Exchange Commission, by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or other self-regulatory organization as defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C., Section 78l, or by an official or agency of this state or of any state of the United States. &nbsp;As used in this section, "licensed associated person of a securities, commodities, or investment broker, dealer, or investment adviser" means an associated person registered or licensed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or other self-regulatory organization as defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C., Section 78l, or by an official or agency of this state or of any state of the United States;</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;A person primarily soliciting the sale of a newspaper of general circulation;</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;A book, video, or record club or contractual plan or arrangement:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;under which the seller provides the consumer with a form which the consumer may use to instruct the seller not to ship the offered merchandise,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;which is regulated by the Trade Regulation Rule regarding the Use of Negative Option Plans by Sellers in Commerce, and</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;which provides for the sale of books, records, or videos which are not covered under subparagraph a or b of this paragraph, including continuity plans, subscription arrangements, standing-order arrangements, supplements, and series arrangements under which the seller periodically ships merchandise to a consumer who has consented in advance to receive such merchandise on a periodic basis;</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;A supervised financial institution or parent, subsidiary, or affiliate thereof operating within the scope of supervised activity. As used in this section, "supervised financial institution" means a commercial bank, trust company, savings and loan association, mutual savings bank, credit union, industrial loan company, consumer finance lender, commercial finance lender, or insurer; provided that the institution is subject to supervision by an official or agency of this state, of any state, or of the United States. &nbsp;For the purposes of this exemption, "affiliate" means a person who directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, a supervised financial institution;</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;Any licensed insurance broker, agent, customer representative, or solicitor when soliciting within the scope of his or her license. &nbsp;As used in this section, "licensed insurance broker, agent, customer representative, or solicitor" means any insurance broker, agent, customer representative, or solicitor licensed by an official or agency of this state or of any state of the United States;</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;A person soliciting the sale of services provided by a cable television system operating under authority of a franchise or permit;</p>

<p>10. &nbsp;A business-to-business sale where:</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;the purchaser business intends to resell or offer for purposes of advertisement or as a promotional item the property or goods purchased, or</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;the purchaser business intends to use the property or goods purchased in a recycling, reuse, remanufacturing, or manufacturing process;</p>

<p>11. &nbsp;A person who solicits sales by periodically publishing and delivering a catalog of the seller's merchandise to prospective purchasers, if the catalog:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;contains a written description or illustration of each item offered for sale,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;includes the business address or home office address of the seller,</p>

<p>19. &nbsp;A person soliciting the sale of food, food product, food ingredient, dietary ingredient, dietary supplement, or beverage for human consumption, if the solicitation neither intends to result in, or actually results in, a sale which costs the purchaser in excess of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00);</p>
