<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. As used in this section:</p>

<p>1. "Loss" means the cost, in dollars, to repair or replace a vehicle which has been damaged by collision or other occurrence. The amount paid by an insurer to a holder of the certificate of title for repair of a damaged vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of the loss. The amount paid by an insurer to a holder of the certificate of title for replacement of a damaged vehicle less the resale value of the damaged vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of the loss;</p>

<p>2. "Fair market value" means the value of a vehicle as listed in the current National Auto Dealers Association guidebook or other similar guidebook or the actual cash value, whichever is greater;</p>

<p>3. "Resale value" means the amount, in dollars, paid to the holder of a certificate of title by a willing buyer for a vehicle damaged by collision or other occurrence or recovered from theft;</p>

<p>4. "Total loss" means a loss which is equal to the fair market value of the vehicle immediately prior to the damage to or theft of the vehicle; and</p>

<p>5. "Vehicle" means a vehicle, as defined in paragraph 40 of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83029">Section 1102</a> of this title, manufactured within the last ten (10) model years.</p>

<p>B. Any insurance company that pays a total loss on a claim for any vehicle including, but not limited to, a flood-damaged vehicle or recovered-theft vehicle, any junk dealer who receives a motor vehicle which is to be used for junk or for parts, or any other person permanently dismantling or junking a vehicle shall receive the certificate of title from the current holder of the certificate of title, shall detach the license plate from the vehicle, and shall return the license plate and the certificate of title to Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator within thirty (30) days from receipt of the certificate, or insurance companies may provide alternate documentation within thirty (30) days pursuant to subsection P of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83034">Section 1105</a> of this title. Service Oklahoma shall cancel the certificate of title to the vehicle used for junk or parts and shall preserve the vehicle identification numbers on the certificate of title in the computer files for at least five (5) years. No certificate of title may be reissued on a junked vehicle as defined in Section 1105 of this title, unless reissued pursuant to paragraph 3 of subsection C of this section. Service Oklahoma shall transfer ownership of a stolen vehicle, not recovered from theft at the time of transfer, by salvage or unrecovered-theft title to the insurer. Service Oklahoma shall transfer ownership of a vehicle damaged by flooding or other occurrence to the insurer by an original title, salvage title, or junked title, as may be appropriate, based upon an estimate of the amount of loss submitted by the insurer. All license plates surrendered to Service Oklahoma shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>C. 1. If an insurance company pays a claim for a loss which is less than a total loss but the cost of repairing the vehicle for safe operation on the highway exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the fair market value of the vehicle, or if any vehicle not insured is damaged to the extent that the cost of repair for safe operation on the highway exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the fair market value of the vehicle, any holder of the certificate of title for the vehicle shall return the certificate of title to Service Oklahoma or a licensed operatorwithin thirty (30) days from receipt of payment for the loss.</p>

<p>2. Upon receipt of the certificate, Service Oklahoma or the licensed operator shall issue a salvage title for the vehicle. The title for any vehicle damaged by flooding shall be stamped with the words "Flood Damaged", and for any such vehicle which was recovered from a theft, the salvage title or rebuilt title shall be stamped with the words "Recovered Theft". A licensed dealer subject to the provisions of the Automotive Dismantlers and Parts Recycler Act, <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82916">Section 591.1</a> et seq. of this title, shall not be required to pay registration fees, excise taxes, back taxes, or penalties on a vehicle as a prerequisite to obtaining a salvage title.</p>

<p>3. If the actual documented cost of repairing the vehicle for safe operation on the highway does not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the fair market value of the vehicle as defined in this section, the certificate of title shall be reissued to the holder and the vehicle shall not be subject to inspection as required under this section. The actual documented cost of repairing the vehicle pursuant to this paragraph shall be certified by the insurance company paying the loss.</p>

<p>D. If a motor vehicle with a salvage title is placed in operative condition, application shall be made to Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator for a rebuilt title. A visual inspection of the vehicle and examination of the vehicle identification numbers shall be conducted prior to the issuance of a rebuilt title. At the time of issuance, the salvage title shall be returned to Service Oklahoma by the owner, or by the licensed operator if the licensed operator issues the rebuilt title. A visual inspection shall also be made of any out-of-state vehicle to be registered and titled in this state if the vehicle is within the class of vehicles for which a rebuilt title is required and a similar inspection has not been conducted by another state. The certificate of title for the rebuilt vehicle shall be stamped with the words, "This Rebuilt Vehicle Has Been Inspected by the Appropriate State Official."</p>

<p>E. 1. The visual inspections and examination of vehicle identification numbers shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. comparison of the vehicle identification numbers with the number recorded on the ownership records,</p>

<p>b. inspection of the vehicle identification numbers and the VIN plate to detect possible alteration or other fraud,</p>

<p>c. interpretation of the vehicle identification number recorded on the ownership documents to assure that it accurately describes the motor vehicle in question, and</p>

<p>d. inspection of the odometer of the vehicle to detect rollback or alteration.</p>

<p>2. All vehicle damage shall be repaired before the examination is conducted. The following paperwork shall be presented to the licensed operator: the salvage title and original receipts for all parts placed on the vehicle. Components such as doors, motor, and transmission shall indicate the serial number or the vehicle identification number (VIN) of the auto the part was purchased from or removed from.</p>

<p>F. The visual inspection and vehicle identification numbers examination shall be performed by a licensed operator at the location designated by the licensed operator. If the location of the inspection is not the place of business of the rebuilder, the licensed operator shall issue a permit authorizing the applicant to operate the vehicle upon the public streets, roads, and highways in route to and from the designated location for the inspection. The inspection and examination shall be performed within ten (10) working days after the owner of the vehicle requests the inspection and examination. Requests shall be made by completing the request form prescribed and provided by Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>G. Inspection and examination of a rebuilt vehicle shall be performed by a person employed by a licensed operator.</p>

<p>H. The fee for the examination by the licensed operator shall be Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00), which shall be paid at the time of issuance of the certificate of title for the rebuilt vehicle. The licensed operator shall retain Five Dollars ($5.00) and shall remit Twenty Dollars ($20.00) to the Tax Commission which shall retain Ten Dollars ($10.00) and transmit Ten Dollars ($10.00) to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Department of Public Safety Revolving Fundthrough December 31, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2023, the licensed operator shall retain Five Dollars ($5.00) and shall remit Twenty Dollars ($20.00) to the Tax Commission which shall retain Ten Dollars ($10.00) and transmit Ten Dollars ($10.00) to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Service Oklahoma Revolving Fund. The licensed operator and its employees and agents may not be sued for and shall not be liable for any damages allegedly arising out of the inspection of a vehicle or any acts or omissions in the performance of the inspection. The licensed operator may be held liable for any damages to the vehicle caused by the negligent acts or omissions in the performance of the inspection. Any person may be liable for any damages to a vehicle caused by the intentional acts or omissions in the performance of the inspection.</p>

<p>I. The rebuilt title and any subsequent transfers of such title shall also reflect that the vehicle was a salvage vehicle, flood-damaged vehicle or recovered-theft vehicle, if applicable, and also shall include the salvage date.</p>

<p>J. Any title for a motor vehicle issued pursuant to the laws of any other state which reflects that such vehicle is a salvage vehicle, a rebuilt vehicle or a junked vehicle or has any other brand or classification notation by that state shall be retained on the new title issued by Service Oklahoma unless the actual documented cost of repairing the vehicle for safe operation on the highway does not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the fair market value of the vehicle as provided by this section.</p>

<p>K. When the insurance company pays a loss on a vehicle which is registered at the time of mishap, accident, burning, or flooding, the appropriate certificate of title shall be issued without the payment of additional registration fees or excise taxes, upon the submission of a police report or insurance adjuster's report and a declaration by the insurer that the vehicle is held for sale to a dealer. If the owner of the vehicle or other insured retains ownership of the damaged vehicle, Service Oklahoma shall notify the owner or insured of the requirements of this section.</p>

<p>L. Any insurance company that pays a claim for a loss where the cost of repairing the vehicle for safe operation on the highway exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the market value of the vehicle or pays a claim for a flood-damaged vehicle as defined in Section 1105 of this title shall notify, in writing, the holder of the certificate of title of the requirements of this section and shall notify Service Oklahoma of the payment of such claim. The notice shall include the estimated total damage percentage determination of the actual cash value made by the insurance company to repair the vehicle for safe operation on the highway. The insurance company shall also send a copy of the notification to the holder of the title. Service Oklahoma shall provide notice to the owner of the vehicle in writing requiring the owner to surrender the title along with the fee to Service Oklahoma or one of its licensed operators within thirty (30) days from the receipt of notice for the issuance of the appropriate title based on the amount of loss. Service Oklahoma shall reissue the appropriate title with the words "Flood Damaged" on the face of the title in the case of a flood-damaged vehicle; provided, no insurance company shall pay a claim for less than the amount to which the holder of the certificate of title is rightfully entitled in order to avoid compliance with this section.</p>

<p>M. Except as provided for in subsection N of this section, any person, firm, corporation, or other legal entity convicted of violating any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) or by incarceration in the county jail for not more than six (6) months, or by both the fine and incarceration.</p>

<p>N. Any owner of a titled vehicle who has knowledge that the title is not the proper type for the vehicle and, with intent to misrepresent the vehicle, fails to make the appropriate title changes, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person who has knowledge that the title is not the proper type for the vehicle, and with intent to misrepresent the vehicle, buys or receives any vehicle for which the appropriate title changes have not been made as required by this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person found guilty in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall be punished by a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the first offense or Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for the second or subsequent offense, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>O. Any owner of a salvage or junked vehicle shall submit the certificate of title to Service Oklahoma or the licensed operator for issuance of an appropriate title. Any holder of a certificate of title issued by this state, to a vehicle which no longer exists, shall surrender the certificate of title to Service Oklahoma for cancellation. The vehicle identification number on the canceled certificate of title shall be preserved in the computer of Service Oklahoma for at least five (5) years.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the transfer of ownership of a vehicle by assignment of the title to a used car dealer, wholesale used car dealer, or a licensed automotive dismantler or parts recycler.</p>
