<hr />
<p>A. For all vehicles, unless otherwise specifically provided by the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, a registration fee shall be assessed at the time of initial registration by the owner and annually thereafter, for the use of the avenues of public access within this state in the following amounts:</p>

<p>1. For the first through the fourth year of registration in this state or any other state, Eighty-five Dollars ($85.00);</p>

<p>2. For the fifth through the eighth year of registration in this state or any other state, Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00);</p>

<p>The registration fee provided for in this subsection shall be in lieu of all other taxes, general or local, unless otherwise specifically provided.</p>

<p>On and after January 1, 2022, if a physically disabled license plate is issued pursuant to paragraph 3 of subsection B of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440343">Section 1135.1</a> of this title, any registration fee required for such license plate and the fee required pursuant to this subsection shall be remitted at the same time and subject to a single registration period. Upon receipt of a physically disabled license plate, the standard issue license plate must be surrendered to Service Oklahoma or the licensed operator. The physically disabled license plate must be properly displayed as required for a standard issue license plate and will be the sole license plate issued and assigned to the vehicle. Service Oklahoma shall determine, by rule, a method for making required fee adjustments when a physically disabled license plate is obtained during a twelve-month period for which a registration fee has already been remitted pursuant to this subsection. The combination of fees in a single remittance shall not alter the apportionment otherwise provided for by law.</p>

<p>B. For all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively for use off roads or highways purchased on or after July 1, 2005, and for all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively for use off roads or highways purchased prior to July 1, 2005, which the owner chooses to register pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=443642">Section 1115.3</a> of this title, an initial and nonrecurring registration fee of Eleven Dollars ($11.00) shall be assessed at the time of initial registration by the owner.

<p>C. For utility vehicles used exclusively for use off roads or highways purchased on or after July 1, 2008, and for utility vehicles used exclusively for use off roads or highways purchased prior to July 1, 2008, which the owner chooses to register pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=443642">Section 1115.3</a> of this title, an initial and nonrecurring registration fee of Eleven Dollars ($11.00) shall be assessed at the time of initial registration by the owner. Nine Dollars ($9.00) of the registration fee shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Reimbursement Fund through December 31, 2022, and beginning January 1, 2023, this fee shall be deposited in the Service Oklahoma Reimbursement Fund. Two Dollars ($2.00) of the registration fee shall be retained by the licensed operator. The fees required by subsection A of this section shall not be required for utility vehicles used exclusively off roads and highways.</p>

<p>1. A new original vehicle which is stolen from the purchaser/registrant within ninety (90) days of the date of purchase of the original vehicle as certified by a police report or other documentation as required by Service Oklahoma; or</p>

<p>2. A defective new original vehicle returned by the purchaser/registrant to the seller within six (6) months of the date of purchase of the defective new original vehicle as certified by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>The credit shall be in the amount of the fee for registration which was paid for the new original vehicle and shall be applied to the registration fee for the replacement vehicle. In no event will the credit be refunded.</p>

<p>E. Upon every transfer or change of ownership of a vehicle, the new owner shall obtain title for and, except in the case of salvage vehicles and manufactured homes, register the vehicle within thirty (30) days of change of ownership and pay a transfer fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) in addition to any other fees provided for in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act.

Thereafter, the owner shall register the vehicle annually on the anniversary date of its initial registration in this state and shall pay the fees provided in subsection A of this section and receive a decal evidencing such payment. Provided, used motor vehicle dealers shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.</p>

<p>F. In the event a new or used vehicle is not registered, titled and tagged within thirty (30) days from the date of transfer of ownership, the penalty for the failure of the owner of the vehicle to register the vehicle within thirty (30) days shall be One Dollar ($1.00) per day, provided that in no event shall the penalty exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). No penalty shall be waived by Service Oklahoma or any licensed operator except as provided in subsection C of Section 1127 of this title, or when it can be shown the vehicle was stolen as certified by a police report or other documentation as required by the Oklahoma Tax Commission.
