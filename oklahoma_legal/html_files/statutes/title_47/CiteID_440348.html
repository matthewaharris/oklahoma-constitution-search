<hr />
<p>A. Service Oklahoma is hereby authorized to design and issue appropriate official special license plates to persons wishing to demonstrate support and provide financial assistance as provided by this section.</p>

<p>Special license plates shall not be transferred to any other person but shall be removed from the vehicle upon transfer of ownership and retained. The special license plate may then be used on another vehicle but only after such other vehicle has been registered for the current year with a licensed operator.</p>

<p>Special license plates shall be renewed each year by Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator, unless authorized by Service Oklahoma to be renewed for a period greater than one (1) year. Service Oklahoma shall notify by mail all persons issued special license plates. The notice shall contain all necessary information and shall contain instructions for the renewal procedure upon presentation to a licensed operator or Service Oklahoma. The license plates shall be issued on a staggered system.</p>

<p>On and after January 1, 2022, if a special license plate is issued pursuant to this section, any registration fee required for such plate pursuant to this section and the fee required pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438851">Section 1132</a> of this title shall be remitted at the same time and subject to a single registration period. Service Oklahoma shall determine, by rule, a method for making required fee and registration period adjustments if a special license plate is obtained during a twelve-month period for which a registration fee has already been remitted pursuant to Section 1132 of this title. The combination of fees in a single remittance shall not alter the apportionment otherwise provided for in this section.</p>

<p>Service Oklahoma is hereby directed to develop and implement a system whereby licensed operators are permitted to accept applications for special license plates authorized under this section. The licensed operator shall confirm the applicant's eligibility, if applicable, collect and deposit any amount specifically authorized by law, accept and process the necessary information directly into such system and generate a receipt accordingly. For performance of these duties, licensed operators shall retain the fee provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83096">Section 1141.1</a> of this title for registration of a motor vehicle through June 30, 2025.

Beginning July 1, 2023, fees shall not be retained by the licensed operator pursuant to subsection E of Section 1141.1 of this title.</p>

<p>If fewer than fifty (50) of any type of special license plates authorized prior to January 1, 2004, are issued prior to January 1, 2006, Service Oklahoma shall discontinue issuance and renewal of that type of special license plate. Any such authorized special license plate registrant shall be allowed to display the license plate upon the designated vehicle until the registration expiration date. After such time the expired special license plate shall be removed from the vehicle.</p>

<p>For special license plates authorized on or after July 1, 2004, no special license plates shall be developed or issued by Service Oklahoma until Service Oklahoma receives one hundred prepaid applications therefor. The prepaid applications must be received by Service Oklahoma within one hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of the authorization or the authority to issue shall be null and void.
