<p>A. It shall be unlawful for any person to commit any of the following acts:</p>

<p>1. To lend or to sell to, or knowingly permit the use of by, one not entitled thereto any certificate of title, license plate or decal issued to or in the custody of the person so lending or permitting the use thereof;</p>

<p>2. To alter or in any manner change a certificate of title, registration certificate, license plate or decal issued under the laws of this or any other state;</p>

<p>3. To procure from another state or country, or display upon any vehicle owned by such person within this state, except as otherwise provided in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, any license plate issued by any state or country other than this state, unless there shall be displayed upon such vehicle at all times the current license plate and decal assigned to it by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission or the vehicle shall display evidence that the vehicle is registered as a nonresident vehicle pursuant to rules promulgated by Service Oklahoma, with the concurrence of the Department of Public Safety. A violation of the provisions of this paragraph shall be presumed to have occurred if a person who is the holder of an Oklahoma driver license operates a vehicle owned by such person on the public roads or highways of this state and there is not displayed on the vehicle a current Oklahoma license plate and decal, unless the vehicle is owned by a member of the Armed Forces of the United States assigned to duty in this state in compliance with official military or naval orders or the spouse of such a member of the Armed Forces;</p>

<p>4. To drive, operate or move, or for the owner to cause or permit to be driven or moved, upon the roads, streets or highways of this state, any vehicle loaded in excess of its registered laden weight, or which is licensed for a capacity less than the manufacturers rated capacity as provided for in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act;</p>

<p>5. To operate a vehicle without proper license plate or decal or on which all taxes due the state have not been paid. No citation may be issued by any state, county or municipal law enforcement officer during the one-month period immediately succeeding the last day of the month during which a vehicle registration should have been renewed and a current license plate decal obtained and displayed on the license plate of the vehicle;</p>

<p>6. To buy, sell or dispose of, or possess for sale, use or storage, any secondhand or used vehicle on which the registration or license fee has not been paid, as required by law, and on which vehicle the person neglects, fails or refuses to display at all times the license plate or decal assigned to it;</p>

<p>7. To give a fictitious name or fictitious address or make any misstatement of facts in application for certificate of title and registration of a vehicle;</p>

<p>8. To purchase a license plate on an assigned certificate of title. This particular paragraph shall be applicable to all persons except a bona fide registered dealer in used cars who are holders of a current and valid used car dealer license;</p>

<p>11. To operate or possess any vehicle which bears a motor number or serial number other than the original number placed thereon by the factory except a number duly assigned and authorized by the state;</p>

<p>12. For any licensed operator to release a license plate, a manufactured home registration receipt, decal or excise tax receipt to any unauthorized person or source including any dealer in new or used motor vehicles. Violation of this paragraph shall constitute sufficient grounds for discharge of a licensed operator by Service Oklahoma;</p>

<p>13. To operate any vehicle registered as a commercial vehicle without the lettering requirements of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83029">Section 1102</a> of this title; or</p>

<p>14.
