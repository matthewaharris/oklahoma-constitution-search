<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Nonresident Violator Compact, hereinafter called 
"the compact", is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other 
jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as 
follows:</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE I. FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF 
POLICY AND PURPOSE</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The party jurisdictions find that:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a 
traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his home jurisdiction:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. must post collateral or bond to secure appearance 
for trial at a later date; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. if unable to post collateral or bond, is taken 
into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. is taken directly to court for his trial to be 
held.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. In some instances, the motorist's driver's license 
may be deposited as collateral to be returned after he has complied with the 
terms of the citation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The purpose of the practices described in 
paragraphs 1 and 2 is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation 
by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the 
traffic citation, could return to his home jurisdiction and disregard his duty 
under the terms of the traffic citation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his 
home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the 
citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately 
continue on his way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms 
of the citation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The practice described in paragraph 1 causes 
unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is 
unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the 
fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be 
made.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. The deposit of a driver's license as a bail bond, 
as described in paragraph 2, is viewed with disfavor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. The practices described herein consume an undue 
amount of law enforcement time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. It is the policy of the party jurisdictions 
to:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances, and 
administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles 
in each of the jurisdictions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Allow motorists to accept a traffic citation for 
certain violations and proceed on their way without delay whether or not the 
motorist is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the citation was 
issued.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the 
jurisdictions for obtaining compliance with the terms of a traffic citation 
issued in one jurisdiction to a resident of another jurisdiction.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement 
personnel and assist court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic 
violations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The purpose of this compact is to:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Provide a means through which the party 
jurisdictions may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies 
enumerated, in paragraph B, in a uniform and orderly manner.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of 
traffic violators operating within party jurisdictions in recognition of the 
motorist's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party 
jurisdiction.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. In the Nonresident Violator Compact, the following 
words have the meaning indicated, unless the context requires otherwise.</FONT>

deposited to secure an appearance for trial, following the issuance by a police 
officer of a citation for a traffic violation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. "Court" means a court of law or traffic 
tribunal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. "Driver's license" means any license or privilege

jurisdiction.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. "Home jurisdiction" means the jurisdiction that 
issued the driver's license of the traffic violator.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. "Issuing jurisdiction" means the jurisdiction in 
which the traffic citation was issued to the motorist.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. "Jurisdiction" means a state, territory or 
possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. "Motorist" means a driver of a motor vehicle 
operating in a party jurisdiction other than the home jurisdiction.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. "Personal recognizance" means an agreement by a 
motorist made at the time of issuance of the traffic citation that he will 
comply with the terms of that traffic citation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. "Police officer" means any individual authorized

<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE III. PROCEDURE FOR ISSUING 
JURISDICTION</FONT> </P>

police officer shall issue the citation to a motorist who possesses a driver's 
license issued by a party jurisdiction and shall not, subject to the exceptions 
noted in paragraph B of this article, require the motorist to post collateral to 
secure appearance, if the officer receives the motorist's personal recognizance 
that he or she will comply with the terms of the citation.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Personal recognizance is acceptable only if not 
prohibited by law. If mandatory appearance is required, it must take place 
immediately following issuance of the citation.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Upon failure of a motorist to comply with the 
terms of a traffic citation, the appropriate official shall report the failure 
to comply to the licensing authority of the jurisdiction in which the traffic 
citation was issued. The report shall be made in accordance with procedures 
specified by the issuing jurisdiction and shall contain information as specified 
in the Compact Manual as minimum requirements for effective processing by the 
home jurisdiction.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Upon receipt of the report, the licensing 
authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall transmit to the licensing authority 
in the home jurisdiction of the motorist the information in a form and content 
as contained in the Compact Manual.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The licensing authority of the issuing 
jurisdiction may not suspend the privilege of a motorist for whom a report has 
been transmitted.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. The licensing authority of the issuing 
jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation if the date of 
transmission is more than six months after the date on which the traffic 
citation was issued.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. The licensing authority of the issuing 
jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation where the date of 
issuance of the citation predates the most recent of the effective dates of 
entry for the two jurisdictions affected.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IV. PROCEDURE FOR HOME 
JURISDICTION</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Upon receipt of a report of a failure to comply 
from the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction, the licensing 
authority of the home jurisdiction shall notify the motorist and initiate a 
suspension action, in accordance with the home jurisdiction's procedures, to 
suspend the motorist's driver's license until satisfactory evidence of 
compliance with the terms of the traffic citation has been furnished to the home 
jurisdiction licensing authority.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The licensing authority of the home jurisdiction 
shall maintain a record of actions taken and make reports to issuing 
jurisdictions as provided in the Compact Manual.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE V. APPLICABILITY OF OTHER 
LAWS</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Except as expressly required by provisions of this 
compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any 
party jurisdiction to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive 
to any person or circumstance, or to invalidate or prevent any driver license 
agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party jurisdiction and a 
nonparty jurisdiction.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VI. COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR 
PROCEDURES</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. For the purpose of administering the provisions of 
this compact and to serve as a governing body for the resolution of all matters 
relating to the operation of this compact, a Board of Compact Administrators is 
established. The board shall be composed of one representative from each party 
jurisdiction to be known as the compact administrator. The compact administrator 
shall be appointed by the jurisdiction executive and will serve and be subject 
to removal in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction he represents. A 
compact administrator may provide for the discharge of his duties and the 
performance of his functions as a board member by an alternate. An alternate may 
not be entitled to serve unless written notification of his identity has been 
given to the board.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Each member of the Board of Compact Administrators 
shall be entitled to one vote. No action of the board shall be binding unless 
taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the board 
are cast in favor. Action by the board shall be only at a meeting at which a 
majority of the party jurisdictions are represented.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The board shall elect annually, from its 
membership, a chairman and a vice-chairman.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The board shall adopt bylaws, not inconsistent 
with the provisions of this compact or the laws of a party jurisdiction, for the 
conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind its 
bylaws.</FONT> </P>

functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, 
equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any 
jurisdiction, the United States, or any other governmental agency, and may 
receive, utilize and dispose of the same.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. The board may contract with, or accept services or 
personnel from, any governmental or intergovernmental agency, person, firm or 
corporation, or any private nonprofit organization or institution.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. The board shall formulate all necessary procedures 
and develop uniform forms and documents for administering the provisions of this 
compact. All procedures and forms adopted pursuant to board action shall be 
contained in the Compact Manual.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VII. ENTRY INTO COMPACT AND 
WITHDRAWAL</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. This compact shall become effective when it has 
been adopted by at least two jurisdictions.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. 1. Entry into the compact shall be made by a 
Resolution of Ratification executed by the authorized officials of the applying 
jurisdiction and submitted to the chairman of the board.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The resolution shall be in a form and content as 
provided in the Compact Manual and shall include statements that in substance 
are as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. a citation of the authority by which the 
jurisdiction is empowered to become a party to this compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. agreement to comply with the terms and provisions 
of the compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. that compact entry is with all jurisdictions then 
party to the compact and with any jurisdiction that legally becomes a party to 
the compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The effective date of entry shall be specified by 
the applying jurisdiction, but it shall not be less than sixty (60) days after 
notice has been given, by the chairman of the Board of Compact Administrators or 
by the secretariat of the board to each party jurisdiction that the resolution 
from the applying jurisdiction has been received.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. A party jurisdiction may withdraw from this 
compact by official written notice to the other party jurisdictions, but a 
withdrawal shall not take effect until ninety (90) days after notice of 
withdrawal is given. The notice shall be directed to the compact administrator 
of each member jurisdiction. No withdrawal shall affect the validity of this 
compact as to the remaining party jurisdictions.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VIII. EXCEPTIONS</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The provisions of this compact shall not apply to 
parking or standing violations, highway weight limit violations, and violations

of all party jurisdictions and shall become effective thirty (30) days after the 
date of the last endorsement.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Failure of a party jurisdiction to respond to the 
compact chairman within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the 
proposed amendment shall constitute endorsement.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE X. CONSTRUCTION AND 
SEVERABILITY</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to 
effectuate the purposes stated herein. The provisions of this compact shall be 
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is 
declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party jurisdiction or of the 
United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 
circumstance the compact shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be 
held contrary to the constitution of any jurisdiction party thereto, the compact 
shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining jurisdictions and in 
full force and effect as to the jurisdiction affected as to all severable 
matters.</FONT> </P><B><I>
