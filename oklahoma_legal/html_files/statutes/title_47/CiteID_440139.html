<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. 1. Every application for a driver license or identification card shall be made by the applicant upon a form furnished by Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>2. Every original, renewal, or replacement application for a driver license or identification card made by a male applicant who is at least sixteen (16) but less than twenty-six (26) years of age shall include a statement that by submitting the application, the applicant is consenting to registration with the Selective Service System. The pertinent information from the application shall be forwarded by Service Oklahoma to the Data Management Center of the Selective Service System in order to register the applicant as required by law with the Selective Service System. Any applicant refusing to sign the consent statement shall be denied a driver license or identification card.</p>

<p>3. Except as provided for in subsections G and H of this section, every applicant for a driver license or identification card shall provide to Service Oklahoma at the time of application a document showing proof of identity. Service Oklahoma shall promulgate rules prescribing forms of identification acceptable for an original Oklahoma driver license.</p>

<p>B. Every applicant for a driver license shall provide the following information:</p>

<p>1. Full name;</p>

<p>2. Date of birth;</p>

<p>3. Sex;</p>

<p>4. Address of principal residence and county of such residence which shall be referenced on the REAL ID Compliant Driver License or Identification Card; proof of principal residency, as prescribed by rules promulgated by Service Oklahoma, documenting provided address;</p>

<p>5. Current and complete mailing address to be maintained by Service Oklahoma for the purpose of giving notice, if necessary, as required by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82005">Section 2-116</a> of this title;</p>

<p>6. Medical information, as determined by the Department, which shall assure Service Oklahoma that the person is not prohibited from being licensed as provided by paragraph 7 of subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=437306">Section 6-103</a> of this title;</p>

<p>7. Whether the applicant is deaf or hard-of-hearing;</p>

<p>8. A brief description of the applicant, as determined by the Department;</p>

<p>9. Whether the applicant has previously been licensed, and, if so, when and by what state or country, and whether any license has ever been suspended or revoked, or whether an application has ever been refused, and, if so, the date of and reason for the suspension, revocation or refusal;</p>

<p>10. Whether the applicant is an alien eligible to be considered for licensure and is not prohibited from licensure pursuant to paragraph 9 of subsection A of Section 6-103 of this title;</p>

<p>11. Whether the applicant has:</p>

<p>a. previously been licensed and, if so, when and by what state or country, and</p>

<p>b. held more than one license at the same time during the immediately preceding ten (10) years; and</p>

<p>12. Social Security number.</p>

<p>No person shall request Service Oklahoma to use the Social Security number of that person as the driver license number. Upon renewal or replacement of any driver license issued after the effective date of this act, the licensee shall advise Service Oklahoma or the licensed operator if the present driver license number of the licensee is the Social Security number of the licensee. If the driver license number is the Social Security number, Service Oklahoma or the licensed operator shall change the driver license number to a computer-generated alphanumeric identification.</p>

<p>C. 1. In addition to the requirements of subsections A and B of this section, every applicant for a commercial driver license who is subject to the requirements of 49 C.F.R., Part 391, and is applying for an original, renewal, or replacement license, and every person who, upon or after May 8, 2012, is currently the holder of a commercial driver license and is subject to the requirements of 49 C.F.R., Part 391, and who does not apply for a renewal or replacement license prior to January 30, 2014, shall submit to Service Oklahoma and maintain with Service Oklahoma a current approved medical examination certificate signed by a licensed physician authorized to perform and approve medical examination certifications. Service Oklahoma shall adopt rules for maintaining medical examination certificates pursuant to the requirements in 49 C.F.R., Parts 383 and 384. Any commercial driver licensee subject to the requirements of this paragraph who fails to maintain on file with Service Oklahoma a current, approved medical examination certificate shall have the driving privileges of the person downgraded to a Class D driver license by Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>2. If the applicant is applying for an original commercial driver license in Oklahoma or is transferring a commercial driver license from another state to Oklahoma, Service Oklahoma shall review the driving record of the applicant in other states for the immediately preceding ten (10) years, unless the record review has already been performed by Service Oklahoma. As a result of the review, if it is determined by Service Oklahoma that the applicant is subject to a period of disqualification as prescribed by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440142">Section 6-205.2</a> of this title which has not yet been imposed, Service Oklahoma shall impose the period of disqualification and the applicant shall serve the period of disqualification before a commercial driver license is issued to the applicant; provided, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the issuance of a Class D driver license to the applicant.</p>

<p>3. If the applicant has or is applying for a hazardous material endorsement, the applicant shall submit to a security threat assessment performed by the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland Security as required by and pursuant to 49 C.F.R., Part 1572, which shall be used to determine whether the applicant is eligible for the endorsement pursuant to federal law and regulation.</p>

<p>4. Service Oklahoma shall notify each commercial driving school of the passage of this section, and each commercial driving school shall notify prospective students of its school of the hazardous material endorsement requirement.</p>

<p>D. In addition to the requirements of subsections A and B of this section, every applicant shall be given an option on the application for issuance of a driver license or identification card or renewal pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438395">Section 6-115</a> of this title to provide an emergency contact person. The emergency contact information requested may include full name, address, and phone number. The emergency contact information shall be maintained by Service Oklahoma and shall be used by Service Oklahoma and law enforcement for emergency purposes only. A person listed as an emergency contact may request to be removed at any time. Any update to a change of name, address, or phone number may be made by the applicant listing the emergency contact person or by the person listed as the emergency contact.</p>

<p>E. Whenever application is received from a person previously licensed in another jurisdiction, Service Oklahoma shall request a copy of the driving record from the other jurisdiction and, effective September 1, 2005, from all other jurisdictions in which the person was licensed within the immediately previous ten (10) years. When received, the driving record shall become a part of the driving record of the person in this state with the same force and effect as though entered on the driver's record in this state in the original instance.</p>

<p>F. Whenever Service Oklahoma receives a request for a driving record from another licensing jurisdiction, the record shall be forwarded without charge.</p>

<p>G. A person shall not apply for or possess more than one state-issued or territory-issued REAL ID Compliant Driver License or Identification Card pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82087">Section 6-101</a> of this title. A valid and unexpired Oklahoma driver license shall serve as both primary and secondary proofs of identity whenever application for a REAL ID Noncompliant Identification Card is submitted to Service Oklahoma. The provisions of subsection B of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=69972">Section 1550.42 of Title 21</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes shall not apply when issuing an identification card pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Service Oklahoma shall promulgate rules necessary to implement and administer the provisions of this subsection.</p>

<p>H. A valid and unexpired U.S. passport shall serve as both primary and secondary proofs of identity whenever application for a driver license or identification card is submitted to the Department. Service Oklahoma shall promulgate rules necessary to implement and administer the provisions of this subsection.</p>
