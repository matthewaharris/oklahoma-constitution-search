<p>A. The Oklahoma Tax Commission is hereby authorized to design and issue appropriate official special license plates to persons as provided by this section.</p>

<p>Special license plates shall not be transferred to any other person but shall be removed from the vehicle upon transfer of ownership and retained. The special license plate may then be used on another vehicle but only after such other vehicle has been registered for the current year.</p>

<p>Except as provided in subsection B of this section, special license plates shall be renewed each year by the Tax Commission or a motor license agent. The Tax Commission shall annually notify by mail all persons issued special license plates. The notice shall contain all necessary information and shall contain instructions for the renewal procedure upon presentation to a motor license agent or the Tax Commission. The license plates shall be issued on a staggered system. The motor license agent fees shall be paid out of the Oklahoma Tax Commission Reimbursement Fund.</p>

<p>On and after January 1, 2022, if a special license plate is issued pursuant to this section, except for Legislative License Plates issued pursuant to paragraph 30 of subsection B of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440344">Section 1135.2</a> of this title, any registration fee required for such plate pursuant to this section and the fee required pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438851">Section 1132</a> of this title shall be remitted at the same time and subject to a single registration period. The Tax Commission shall determine, by rule, a method for making required fee and registration period adjustments if a special license plate is obtained during a twelve-month period for which a registration fee has already been remitted pursuant to Section 1132 of this title. The combination of fees in a single remittance shall not alter the apportionment otherwise provided for in this section.</p>

<p>On and after January 1, 2022, if a physically disabled license plate is issued pursuant to paragraph 3 of subsection B of this section, any registration fee required for such plate pursuant to this section and the fee required pursuant to Section 1132 of this title shall be remitted at the same time and subject to a single registration period. The Tax Commission shall determine, by rule, a method for making required fee and registration period adjustments when a physically disabled license plate is obtained during a twelve-month period for which a registration fee has already been remitted pursuant to Section 1132 of this title. The combination of fees in a single remittance shall not alter the apportionment otherwise provided for in this section.</p>

<p>B. The special license plates provided by this section are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Political Subdivision Plates - such plates shall be designed for any vehicle owned by any political subdivision of this state having obtained a proper Oklahoma certificate of title. Such political subdivisions shall file an annual report with the Tax Commission stating the agency where such vehicle is located. Such license plates shall be permanent in nature and designed in such a manner as to remain with the vehicle for the duration of the life span of the vehicle or until the title is transferred to an owner who is not a political subdivision.</p>

<p>The registration fee shall be Eight Dollars ($8.00) and shall be in addition to all other registration fees provided by law, except the registration fees levied by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?box1=438851&amp;box2=&amp;box3=">Section 1132</a> of this title;</p>

<p>Except as provided in subparagraph g of this paragraph, the registration fee shall be Eight Dollars ($8.00) and shall be in addition to all other registration fees provided by law, except the registration fees levied by Section 1132 of this title;</p>

For an additional fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00), a person eligible for a physically disabled license plate shall have the option of purchasing a duplicate physically disabled special license plate which shall be securely attached to the front of the vehicle. The original physically disabled special license plate shall be securely attached to the rear of the vehicle at all times.</p>

<p>Any person who is eligible for a physically disabled license plate and whose vehicle has had modifications because of the physical disability of the owner or of a family member within the second degree of consanguinity of the owner, may register the vehicle for a flat fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00). This fee shall be in lieu of all other registration fees provided by the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act;</p>
