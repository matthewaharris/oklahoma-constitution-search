<P>A. The Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement Board shall discharge its duties 
with respect to the System solely in the interest of the participants and 
beneficiaries and:</P>
<P>1. For the exclusive purpose of:</P>
<P>a. providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries, and</P>
<P>b. defraying reasonable expenses of administering the System;</P>
<P>2. With the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then 
prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with 
such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and 
with like aims;</P>
<P>3. By diversifying the investments of the System so as to minimize the risk 
of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do 
so; and</P>
<P>4. In accordance with the laws, documents and instruments governing the 
System.</P>
<P>B. The Board may procure insurance indemnifying the members of the Board from 
personal loss or accountability from liability resulting from a member's action 
or inaction as a member of the Board.</P>
<P>C. The Board may establish an investment committee. The investment committee 
shall be composed of not more than five (5) members of the Board appointed by 
the president of the Board. The committee shall make recommendations to the full 
Board on all matters related to the choice of custodians and managers of the 
assets of the System, on the establishment of investment and fund management 
guidelines, and in planning future investment policy. The committee shall have 
no authority to act on behalf of the Board in any circumstances whatsoever. No 
recommendation of the committee shall have effect as an action of the Board nor 
take effect without the approval of the Board as provided by law.</P>
<P>D. The Board shall retain qualified investment managers to provide for the 
investment of the monies of the System. The investment managers shall be chosen 
by a solicitation of proposals on a competitive bid basis pursuant to standards 
set by the Board. Subject to the overall investment guidelines set by the Board, 
the investment managers shall have full discretion in the management of those 
monies of the System allocated to the investment managers. The Board shall 
manage those monies not specifically allocated to the investment managers. The 
monies of the System allocated to the investment managers shall be actively 
managed by the investment managers, which may include selling investments and 
realizing losses if such action is considered advantageous to longer term return 
maximization. Because of the total return objective, no distinction shall be 
made for management and performance evaluation purposes between realized and 
unrealized capital gains and losses.</P>
<P>E. All assets of the System shall be held in trust for the exclusive purpose 
of providing benefits for the members and beneficiaries of the System, including 
defraying reasonable expenses of administering the System, and shall not be 
encumbered for or diverted to any other purposes. Funds and revenues for 
investment by the investment managers or the Board shall be placed with a 
custodian selected by the Board. The custodian shall be a bank or trust company 
offering pension fund master trustee and master custodial services, and any 
related custodial agreement or trust agreement is incorporated herein by 
reference. The custodian shall be chosen by a solicitation of proposals on a 
competitive bid basis pursuant to standards set by the Board. In compliance with 
the investment policy guidelines of the Board, the custodian bank or trust 
company shall be contractually responsible for ensuring that all monies of the 
System are invested in income-producing investment vehicles at all times. If a 
custodian bank or trust company has not received direction from the investment 
managers of the System as to the investment of the monies of the System in 
specific investment vehicles, the custodian bank or trust company shall be 
contractually responsible to the Board for investing the monies in appropriately 
collateralized short-term interest-bearing investment vehicles. Any assets of 
the System may be invested in a collective investment fund or in a group trust 
provided the investment in such collective investment fund or group trust is in 
compliance with the provisions of Rev. Rul. 81-100, as further amended by Rev. 
Rul. 2004-67, Rev. Rul. 2008-40, and Rev. Rul. 2011-1, or any successor ruling, 
regulation, or similar pronouncement. Each such collective investment fund or 
group trust is adopted with respect to any monies invested therein, as part of 
the System, its trust and custodial agreement, and the provisions of such trust 
agreement or such declaration of trust and related adoption, participation, 
investment management, subtrust or other agreements, as amended from time to 
time, with respect to any monies invested therein, are incorporated by reference 
into the System, its trust agreement(s) or custodial agreement(s), upon approval 
by the Board.</P>
<P>F. Prior to August 1 of each year, the Board shall develop a written 
investment plan for the System.</P>
<P>G. The Board shall compile a quarterly financial report of all the funds of 
the System on a fiscal year basis. The report shall be compiled pursuant to 
uniform reporting standards prescribed by the Oklahoma State Pension Commission 
for all state retirement systems. The report shall include several relevant 
measures of investment value, including acquisition cost and current fair market 
value with appropriate summaries of total holdings and returns. The report shall 
contain combined and individual rate of returns of the investment managers by 
category of investment, over periods of time. The Board shall include in the 
quarterly reports all commissions, fees or payments for investment services 
performed on behalf of the Board. The report shall be distributed to the 
Governor, the Oklahoma State Pension Commission, the Legislative Service Bureau, 
the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the 
Senate.</P>
<P>H. After July 1 and before October 31 of each year, the Board shall publish 
widely an annual report presented in simple and easily understood language 
pursuant to uniform reporting standards prescribed by the Oklahoma State Pension 
Commission for all state retirement systems. The report shall be submitted to 
the Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President Pro 
Tempore of the Senate, the Oklahoma State Pension Commission and the members of 
the System. The annual report shall cover the operation of the System during the 
past fiscal year, including income, disbursements, and the financial condition 
of the System at the end of the fiscal year. The annual report shall also 
contain the information issued in the quarterly reports required pursuant to 
subsection G of this section as well as a summary of the results of the most 
recent actuarial valuation to include total assets, total liabilities, unfunded 
liability or over funded status, contributions and any other information deemed 
relevant by the Board. The annual report shall be written in such a manner as to 
permit a readily understandable means for analyzing the financial condition and 
performance of the System for the fiscal year. The annual financial statements 
must be audited and filed in accordance with the requirements set forth for 
financial statement audits in Section 212A of Title 74 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</P>
<P>I. The Board may retain an attorney licensed to practice law in this state. 
The attorney shall serve at the pleasure of the Board for such compensation as 
set by the Board. The Attorney General shall furnish such legal services as may 
be requested by the Board.</P>
<P>J. All information, documents and copies thereof contained in a member's 
retirement file shall be given confidential treatment and shall not be made 
public by the System without the prior written consent of the member to which it 
pertains, but shall be subject only to court order. Provided, the System, its 
employees or attorneys, may use such records in defense of any action brought 
against the System.</P>
<P>K. Effective July 1, 1999, the Board is hereby authorized to do all acts and 
things necessary and proper to carry out the purpose of the System and to make 
the least costly amendments and changes, if any, as may be necessary to qualify 
the System under the applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
as amended.</P>
<P>L. The Executive Director and such employees of the System as the Executive 
Director may designate are hereby authorized to prepare certified copies of 
records of the System and every such certified copy shall be admissible in any 
proceeding in any court in like manner as the original thereof.</P>
<P>M. On or after July 1, 2011, the Board may permit, effective for applicable 
notices, elections and consents provided or made for a member, beneficiary, 
alternate payee or individual entitled to benefits under the System, the use of 
electronic media to provide applicable notices and make such elections and 
consents as described in Section 1.401(a)-21 of the Income Tax Regulations.</P>
<P>N. The Board shall develop such procedures and may require such information 
from the distributing plan as it deems necessary to reasonably conclude that a 
potential rollover contribution is a valid rollover contribution under Section 
1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&amp;A-14(b)(2), of the Income Tax Regulations.</P>
