<P>A. The district attorney may file a motion requesting forfeiture of the motor 
vehicle involved in the commission of an eligible offense as provided in this 
section. The provisions of this section shall apply to:</P>
<P>1. Any person who has been previously convicted of an offense under Section 
11-902, 11-903, or 11-904 of this title and who on or after July 1, 1999, is 
convicted of an offense under Section 11-902, 11-903, or 11-904 of this title 
within ten (10) years of any prior conviction under Section 11-902, 11-903, or 
11-904 of this title and where at least one of the offenses, current or prior, 
involved the death of or serious bodily injury to another person; or</P>
<P>2. Any person who has been convicted of a third or subsequent felony offense 
under Section 11-902 of this title.</P>
<P>B. A motion for forfeiture may be filed at the time of charging but not later 
than thirty (30) days after the verdict or plea of guilty or nolo contendere. If 
a motion of intent to forfeit is filed prior to the verdict or plea of guilty or 
nolo contendere, the proceedings shall be stayed until the disposition of the 
criminal case. Notice shall be required even though the proceedings are stayed. 
If the motion is filed prior to the disposition on the criminal case, the 
district attorney shall notify the Oklahoma Tax Commission and the Tax 
Commission shall place a lien upon the vehicle title. No person shall sell, 
damage, destroy, transfer or perfect a security interest on any vehicle subject 
to forfeiture. Prior to filing a motion for forfeiture, the district attorney 
shall verify whether the vehicle was sold during any period of impoundment as 
provided by law. Any vehicle sold in an impound sale to pay towing, wrecker 
services or storage expenses shall not be subject to forfeiture as provided in 
this section.</P>
<P>C. Upon filing a motion for forfeiture, except when the proceedings are 
stayed pursuant to subsection B of this section, the court shall schedule a 
hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be not less than twenty (20) days nor 
more than forty-five (45) days from the date the motion is filed. The district 
attorney within three (3) days of filing a motion of intent to forfeit shall 
notify the convicted person, lienholders of record, and any person appearing to 
have an ownership or security interest in the vehicle. The notice shall contain 
the date, time and place of the hearing. When a motion for forfeiture has been 
stayed pending disposition of the criminal case and a verdict or plea of guilty 
or nolo contendere has been entered, the district attorney shall give notice of 
the forfeiture hearing not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The 
notice of persons specified in this subsection shall be by certified mail to the 
address shown upon the records of the Oklahoma Tax Commission. For owners or 
interested parties, other than lienholders of record, whose addresses are 
unknown, but who are believed to have an interest in the vehicle, notice shall 
be by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where 
the motion is filed. The written notice shall include:</P>
<P>1. A full description of the motor vehicle;</P>
<P>2. The date, time and place of the forfeiture hearing;</P>
<P>3. The legal authority under which the motor vehicle may be forfeited; 
and</P>
<P>4. Notice of the right to intervene to protect an interest in the motor 
vehicle.</P>
<P>D. A forfeiture proceeding shall not extinguish any security interest of a 
lienholder of record; provided, however, the court may order the sale of the 
motor vehicle and the satisfaction of that security interest from the proceeds 
of sale as provided in subsection K of this section.</P>
<P>For purposes of a forfeiture proceeding, an affidavit obtained from the 
lienholder of record, in the absence of evidence of bad faith, shall be prima 
facie evidence of the amount of secured indebtedness owed to that lienholder. It 
shall be the responsibility of the district attorney to obtain such affidavit 
prior to the forfeiture proceeding.</P>
<P>In the absence of evidence of bad faith, no lienholder of record shall be 
required to attend the forfeiture proceeding to protect its interest in the 
motor vehicle. However, each lienholder of record shall be given notice of the 
forfeiture hearing as provided in subsection C of this section. The district 
attorney shall notify each lienholder of record at least ten (10) days before 
the sale of the motor vehicle ordered forfeited pursuant to this section; 
provided, the lienholder was not represented at the forfeiture proceeding.</P>
<P>E. Any person having an ownership or security interest in a vehicle subject 
to forfeiture which is not perfected by a lien of record may file a written 
objection to the motion to forfeit within ten (10) days of the mailing of the 
notice of intent to forfeit.</P>
<P>F. At the hearing, any person who claims an ownership or security interest in 
the motor vehicle which is not perfected by a lien of record shall be required 
to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that:</P>
<P>1. The person has an interest in the motor vehicle and such interest was 
acquired in good faith;</P>
<P>2. The person is not the person convicted of the offense that resulted in the 
forfeiture proceeding; and</P>
<P>3. The person did not know or have reasonable cause to believe that the 
vehicle would be used in the commission of a felony offense.</P>
<P>G. If a person satisfies the requirements of subsection F of this section, or 
if there is a lienholder of record that has provided an affidavit pursuant to 
subsection D of this section, the court shall order either an amount equal to 
the value of the interest of that person in the motor vehicle to be paid to that 
person upon sale of the motor vehicle after payment of costs and expenses or 
release the vehicle from the forfeiture proceedings if either the lienholder 
described in subsection D of this section or the person intervening in 
accordance with subsection F of this section has full right, title and interest 
in the vehicle.</P>
<P>H. At the hearing, the court may order the forfeiture of the motor vehicle if 
it is determined by a preponderance of the evidence that the forfeiture of the 
motor vehicle will serve one or more of the following purposes:</P>
<P>1. Incapacitation of the convicted person from the commission of any future 
offense under Section 11-902, 11-903, or 11-904 of this title;</P>
<P>2. Protection of the safety and welfare of the public;</P>
<P>3. Deterrence of other persons who are potential offenders under Section 
11-902, 11-903, or 11-904 of this title;</P>
<P>4. Expression of public condemnation of the serious or aggravated nature of 
the conduct of the convicted person; or</P>
<P>5. Satisfaction of monetary amounts for criminal penalties.</P>
<P>I. Upon forfeiture of a motor vehicle pursuant to this act, the court shall 
require the owner to surrender the motor vehicle, the certificate of title, and 
the registration of the motor vehicle. The vehicle, the certificate of title, 
and the registration shall be delivered to the Department of Public Safety 
within three (3) days of the forfeiture order. The expense of delivering the 
vehicle shall be paid by the district attorney. Costs of delivering the vehicle 
to the Department shall be reimbursable as costs of conducting the sale. A motor 
vehicle forfeited pursuant to this act, shall be sold by the Department of 
Public Safety as provided by law for the sale of other forfeited property, 
except as otherwise provided in this section.</P>
<P>J. If a vehicle was impounded at the time of delivery to the Department and a 
forfeiture order is subsequently issued, all towing, wrecker services, and 
storage expenses shall be satisfied from the sale of the vehicle. If a vehicle 
is released from forfeiture and the vehicle has been delivered to the Department 
with impound expenses still owing, all impound expenses, including towing, 
wrecker service and storage expenses, shall be paid by the person prevailing on 
the dismissal of the forfeiture proceeding and the release of the vehicle to 
such person. If a notice for sale of the vehicle was filed for satisfaction of 
impound expenses prior to the filing of a motion for forfeiture, the vehicle 
shall be sold as provided by law for unpaid towing, wrecker services, and 
storage expenses and shall not be subject to forfeiture. If the convicted person 
redeems his or her interest in the vehicle at a sale for impound expenses, a 
forfeiture proceeding may thereafter proceed as authorized by this act. Neither 
the notice of sale for towing, wrecker services, and storage expenses nor the 
sale of such vehicle for impound expenses shall serve to extend the requirement 
for filing a motion to forfeit as provided in subsection B of this section.</P>
<P>K. Except as provided in subsection J of this section, proceeds from the sale 
of any vehicle forfeited pursuant to this act shall be paid in the following 
order:</P>
<P>1. To satisfy the interest of any lienholder of record;</P>
<P>2. To the Department of Public Safety for the cost of conducting the sale, 
including expense of delivery, court filing fees, and publication expense;</P>
<P>3. To satisfy impound expenses, including any towing, wrecker service and 
storage expenses incurred prior to delivery to the Department of Public 
Safety;</P>
<P>4. To satisfy the interest of any person making proof as provided in 
subsection F of this section;</P>
<P>5. To satisfy criminal penalties, costs and assessments pursuant to paragraph 
5 of subsection H of this section if so ordered by the court;</P>
<P>6. To the office of the district attorney who filed the forfeiture proceeding 
not exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of any remaining proceeds. Such payment 
shall be deposited in a special fund for such purpose as determined by the 
district attorney's office; and</P>
<P>7. The balance of the proceeds to be deposited in the Drug Abuse Education 
and Treatment Revolving Fund established pursuant to Section 2-503.2 of Title 63 
of the Oklahoma Statutes for the benefit of drug court treatment as provided by 
law.</P>
<P>L. If a motor vehicle subject to forfeiture as provided by this act is a 
vehicle leased pursuant to a commercial rental agreement for a period of ninety 
(90) days or less, then the vehicle shall not be subject to the forfeiture 
proceedings provided by this act.</P></FONT>
<DL>
  <DT>M. Upon the court dismissing a forfeiture proceeding, any lien placed upon 
  the vehicle title by the Oklahoma Tax Commission pursuant to subsection B of 
  this section shall be released.</DT></DL>
