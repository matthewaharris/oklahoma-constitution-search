<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Upon the death of a retired member or upon the 
death of any member prior to retirement or other termination of covered 
employment, a monthly pension shall be paid which shall be in an amount as 
provided below:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. If the member was not retired and death occurred 
as the direct result of the performance of the member's duties as an officer, an 
amount:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. equal to two and one-half percent (2 
1/2%),</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. multiplied by:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) twenty (20) years of service, regardless of the 
actual number of years of credited service performed by the member prior to the 
date of death if the member had performed less than twenty (20) years of 
service, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) the actual number of years of service performed 
by the member if the member had performed twenty (20) or more years of service, 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. multiplied by a final average salary equal 
to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) the salary which the member would have received 
pursuant to statutory salary schedules in effect upon the date of death for 
twenty (20) years of service if the member did not actually perform twenty (20) 
years of service prior to death. The final average salary for a member who 
performed less than twenty (20) years of service prior to death shall be 
computed assuming that the member was paid the highest salary allowable pursuant 
to the law in effect at the time of the members death based upon twenty (20) 
years of service and with an assumption that the member was eligible for any and 
all increases in pay based upon rank during the entire period. If the salary of 
a member is not prescribed by a specific salary schedule upon the date of the 
members death, the final average salary for the member shall be computed by the 
members actual final average salary or the highest median salary amount for a 
member whose salary was prescribed by a specific salary schedule upon the date 
of the members death, whichever final average salary amount would be greater, 
or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) the actual final average salary of the member if 
the member had performed twenty (20) or more years of service prior to death; 
or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If the member was not retired and death occurred 
other than as the direct result of the performance of the member's duties as an 
officer, an amount equal to the monthly payments which would have been received 
by the member under subsection E of Section 2-305 of this title had the member 
been totally disabled; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If said member was retired for length of service, 
an amount equal to the member's monthly payments; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If said member was receiving, or eligible to 
receive, a disability benefit pursuant to subsection E or F of Section 2-305 of 
this title, an amount equal to the member's monthly payments pursuant to 
subsection E or F of Section 2-305 of this title; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. If said member was receiving, or eligible to 
receive, a disability benefit pursuant to subsection G of Section 2-305 of this 
title, an amount equal to the members monthly payments pursuant to subsection G 
of Section 2-305 of this title; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. If said member was retired for partial disability, 
an amount equal to the monthly payments which would have been received by said 
member had the member been totally disabled.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The pension provided for in subsection A of this 
section shall be paid:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Except as provided in paragraph 4 of this 
subsection, to the surviving spouse, provided the surviving spouse was married 
to the member at the time of the member's death, and continuously for the thirty 
(30) months immediately preceding the member's death, provided a surviving 
spouse of a member who died while in, or as a consequence of, the performance of 
the member's duty for the employer, shall not be subject to the thirty-month 
marriage requirement for survivor benefits; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If there is no surviving spouse or upon the death 
of a spouse:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. to the person having the care and custody of any 
surviving child or children of said member for such time as such child or 
children are under the age of eighteen (18) years, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. to the surviving child or children between the age 
of eighteen (18) and twenty-two (22) years if the child is enrolled full time in 
and is regularly attending a public or private school or any institution of 
higher education;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If there is no surviving spouse or children under 
the age of eighteen (18) years or under the age of twenty-two (22) years if the 
child is enrolled full time in and is regularly attending a public or private 
school or any institution of higher education, to the dependent parent or 
parents of said member, for life; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. In the event a surviving spouse remarried prior to 
June 7, 1993, and was a surviving spouse of a member who died while in, or as a 
consequence of, the performance of the member's duty for the employer, the 
surviving spouse shall be eligible to receive the pension benefits provided for 
in subsection A of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>To receive the pension benefits provided for in 
subsection A of this section the surviving spouse falling within this paragraph 
shall submit a written request for such benefits to the Oklahoma Law Enforcement 
Retirement System. The Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System shall approve 
requests by surviving spouses meeting the requirements of this paragraph. Upon 
approval by the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System, the surviving spouse 
shall be entitled to the pension benefits provided for in subsection A of this 
section beginning from the date of approval forward. Pension benefits provided 
to surviving spouses falling within this paragraph shall not apply to alter any 
amount of pension benefits paid or due prior to the Oklahoma Law Enforcement 
Retirement System's approval of the remarried surviving spouse's written request 
for benefits.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>No surviving spouse shall receive benefits from this 
section, Section 49-113 of Title 11 of the Oklahoma Statutes, or Section 50-117 
of Title 11 of the Oklahoma Statutes as the surviving spouse of more than one 
member of the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System, the Oklahoma 
Police Pension and Retirement System, or the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement 
System. The surviving spouse of more than one member shall elect which member's 
benefits he or she will receive.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. In addition to the pension above provided for, if 
said member leaves a surviving spouse and one or more children under the age of 
eighteen (18) years or under the age of twenty-two (22) years if the child is 
enrolled full time in and is regularly attending a public or private school or 
any institution of higher education, Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) a month 
shall be paid from said Fund for the support of each surviving child to the 
person having the care and custody of such children during such time as said 
spouse remains alive and until each child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years 
or reaches the age of twenty-two (22) years if the child is enrolled full time 
in and is regularly attending a public or private school or any institution of 
higher education.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Upon the death of a retired member, the benefit 
payment for the month in which the retired member died, if not previously paid, 
shall be made to the beneficiary of the member or to the member's estate if 
there is no beneficiary. Such benefit payment shall be made in an amount equal 
to a full monthly benefit payment regardless of the day of the month in which 
the retired member died. &nbsp;</FONT></P><B><I>
