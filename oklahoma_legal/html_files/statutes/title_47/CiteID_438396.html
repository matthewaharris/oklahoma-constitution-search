<p>A. Service Oklahoma shall file every application for a driver license or identification card received by Service Oklahoma and shall maintain suitable indexes containing:</p>

<p>1. All applications denied and on each thereof note the reasons for the denial;</p>

<p>2. All applications granted;</p>

<p>3. The name of every person whose driving privilege has been suspended, revoked, canceled, or disqualified by Service Oklahoma and after each such name note the reasons for the action. Any notation of suspension of the driving privilege of a person for reason of nonpayment of a fine shall be removed from the driving record after the person has paid the fine and the driving privilege of the person is reinstated as provided for by law;</p>

<p>4. The county of residence, the name, date of birth, and mailing address of each person residing in that county who is eighteen (18) years of age or older, and who is the holder of a current driver license or a current identification card issued by Service Oklahoma for the purpose of ascertaining names of all persons qualified for jury service as required by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=78213">Section 18 of Title 38</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes; and</p>

<p>5. The name, driver license number, and mailing address of every person for the purpose of giving notice, if necessary, as required by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82005">Section 2-116</a> of this title.</p>

<p>B. Service Oklahoma shall file all collision reports and abstracts of court records of convictions received by it pursuant to the laws of this state and maintain convenient records of the records and reports or make suitable notations in order that an individual record of a person showing the convictions of the person and the traffic collisions in which the person has been involved shall be readily ascertainable and available for the consideration of Service Oklahoma upon any application for a driver license or renewal of a driver license and at other suitable times. Any abstract, index or other entry relating to a driving record according to the licensing authority in another state or a province of Canada may be posted upon the driving record of any resident of this state when notice thereof is received by documentation or by electronic transmission. The individual record of a person shall not include any collision reports and abstracts of court records involving a collision in which the person was not issued a citation or if a citation is issued and the person was not convicted.</p>

<p>C. 1. Service Oklahoma may designate and is hereby authorized to prepare under the seal of Service Oklahoma and deliver upon request a copy of any collision report on file with the Department, charging a fee of:</p>

<p>a. beginning on July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2013, Fifteen Dollars ($15.00), of which Eight Dollars ($8.00) shall be deposited by the Commissioner to the credit of the Department of Public Safety Revolving Fund and, in addition to other purposes authorized by law, the expenditures from that fund of monies derived from the Eight Dollars ($8.00) pursuant to this subparagraph shall be used to fund any Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Academy provided by the Department of Public Safety. Any remaining funds shall be deposited in an account to be utilized exclusively for future expenses directly related to the operation of an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Academy, and</p>

<p>b. beginning on July 1, 2013, and any year thereafter, Seven Dollars ($7.00).</p>

<p>However, Service Oklahoma shall not be required to furnish personal information from the collision report which is contrary to the provisions of the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, 18 United States Code, Sections 2721 through 2725.</p>

<p>2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection, Service Oklahoma is authorized to enter into contracts to supply information regarding vehicles reported to be involved in collisions. For each vehicle, the information shall be limited to that which only describes the vehicle and the collision. Service Oklahoma shall not be required to provide any information regarding the owner or operator of the vehicle or any information which would conflict with <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439094">Section 2-110</a> or <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440190">Section 1109</a> of this title.</p>

<p>D. Service Oklahoma or any licensed operator upon request shall prepare and furnish to any authorized person a Motor Vehicle Report of any person subject to the provisions of the motor vehicle laws of this state. However, Service Oklahoma shall not be required to furnish personal information from a driving record contrary to the provisions of the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, 18 United States Code, Sections 2721 through 2725. The Motor Vehicle Report shall be a summary of the driving record of the person and shall include the enumeration of any motor vehicle collisions, reference to convictions for violations of motor vehicle laws, and any action taken against the privilege of the person to operate a motor vehicle, as shown by the files of Service Oklahoma for the three (3) years preceding the date of the request. The Motor Vehicle Report, to include any record or information associated with the Motor Vehicle Report, shall not be deemed a public civil record as defined in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440214">Section 18 of Title 22</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, and shall not be subject to expungement. Service Oklahoma shall not be required to release to any person, in whole or in part and in any format, a driving index, as described in subsection A of this section, except as otherwise provided for by law. For each Motor Vehicle Report furnished by Service Oklahoma, Service Oklahoma shall collect the sum of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00), Twenty Dollars ($20.00) of which shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund and Five Dollars ($5.00) shall be deposited in the Department of Public Safety Revolving Fund through October 31, 2022.

Persons sixty-five (65) years of age or older shall not be required to pay a fee for their own Motor Vehicle Report furnished by Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator. For purposes of this subsection, a Motor Vehicle Report shall include a report which indicates that no driving record is on file with Service Oklahoma for the information received by Service Oklahoma in the request for the Motor Vehicle Report.</p>

<p>E. Service Oklahoma may develop procedures whereby an acting agent of an employer or an employer of a person:</p>

<p>1. Who has a Class A, B, C or D driver license; and</p>

<p>2. Who operates a commercial, company-owned or personal motor vehicle during the course of business in the course of his or her employment with the employer, may automatically be notified, pursuant to a fee schedule established by Service Oklahoma, should the driving record of a person reflect a traffic conviction in any court or an administrative action by Service Oklahoma which alters the status of the commercial driving privileges of the person, or any other change to the driving status. The notification system shall include electronic delivery of a Motor Vehicle Report at least annually for any employee who is a commercial driver licensee or who operates a commercial motor vehicle, as required by 49 C.F.R., Section 391.25, or who operates a company-owned or personal motor vehicle during the course of business. All monies received by the Commissioner of Public Safety and the officers and employees of the Department pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the Department of Public Safety Restricted Revolving Fund through October 31, 2022. Beginning November 1, 2022, all monies received by the Director of Service Oklahoma and the officers and employees of Service Oklahoma pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the Service Oklahoma Revolving Fund.

Two Dollars ($2.00) shall be retained by Service Oklahoma or its authorized agent for the purpose of development and maintenance of the electronic notification system.</p>

<p>F. Service Oklahoma is authorized to establish a procedure for reviewing the driving records of state residents who are existing policyholders of any insurance company licensed to operate in this state during specified periods of time and producing a report which identifies the policyholders which have had violation and/or status changes to their driving records during such time period. Service Oklahoma may sell such report to the insurance company or its agent at a fee to be set by Service Oklahoma. Any such report sold by Service Oklahoma shall only consist of information otherwise lawfully obtainable by the insurance company or its agent. The fee shall be sufficient to recover all costs incurred by Service Oklahoma and ensure that there will be no net revenue loss to the state. Such fee shall be deposited in the Department of Public Safety Revolving Fund through October 31, 2022. Beginning November 1, 2022, such fee shall be deposited in the Service Oklahoma Revolving Fund.</p>

<p>G. All monies received by the Commissioner of Public Safety or Service Oklahoma and the officers and employees of the Department shall be remitted to the State Treasurer to be credited to the General Revenue Fund in the State Treasury except as otherwise provided for by law.</p>
