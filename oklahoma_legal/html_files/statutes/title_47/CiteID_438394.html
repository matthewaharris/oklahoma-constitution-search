<p><em><strong>Multiple Amendments Enacted in the 2025 Legislative Session</strong></em></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Version 1 (Amended by Laws 2025, SB 20, c. 310, § 2, emerg. eff. May 27, 2025)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;A. 1. Service Oklahoma shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue to every applicant qualifying therefor a Class A, B, C or D driver license or identification card as applied for, which license or card shall bear thereon a distinguishing alphanumeric identification assigned to the licensee or cardholder, date of issuance and date of expiration of the license or card, the full legal name, signature or computerized signature, date of birth, residence address, unless specified as an exception in 6 C.F.R., Section 37.17, sex, a computerized color image of the licensee or cardholder taken in accordance with Service Oklahoma rules and security features as determined by Service Oklahoma. The image shall depict a full front unobstructed view of the entire face of the licensee or cardholder; provided, a commercial learner permit shall not bear the image of the licensee. When any person is issued both a driver license and an identification card, Service Oklahoma shall ensure the information on both the license and the card are the same, unless otherwise provided by law.</p>

<p>2. A driver license or identification card issued by Service Oklahoma on or after March 1, 2004, shall bear thereon the county of residence of the licensee or cardholder.</p>

<p>3. Service Oklahoma may cancel the distinguishing number, when that distinguishing number is another persons Social Security number, assign a new distinguishing alphanumeric identification, and issue a new license or identification card without charge to the licensee or cardholder.</p>

<p>4. Service Oklahoma may promulgate rules for inclusion of the height and a brief description of the licensee or cardholder on the face of the card or license identifying the licensee or cardholder as deaf or hard-of-hearing.</p>

<p>5. It is unlawful for any person to apply, adhere, or otherwise attach to a driver license or identification card any decal, sticker, label, or other attachment. Any law enforcement officer is authorized to remove and dispose of any unlawful decal, sticker, label, or other attachment from the driver license of a person. The law enforcement officer, the employing agency of the officer, Service Oklahoma, and the State of Oklahoma shall be immune from any liability for any loss suffered by the licensee, cardholder, or the owner of the decal, sticker, label, or other attachment caused by the removal and destruction of the decal, sticker, label, or other attachment.</p>

<p>6. Service Oklahoma may develop by rule a procedure which complies with the provisions of subsection G of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82087">Section 6-101</a>&nbsp;of this title whereby a person may apply for a renewal or replacement Oklahoma Class D license or Oklahoma identification card.</p>

<p>B. 1. Service Oklahoma may issue or authorize the issuance of a temporary permit or license to an applicant for a driver license permitting such applicant to operate a motor vehicle while Service Oklahoma is completing its investigation and determination of all facts relative to such applicants privilege to receive a license, or while a permanent driver license is being produced and delivered to the applicant. Such permit or license must be in the immediate possession of the driver while operating a motor vehicle, and it shall be invalid when the applicants permanent driver license has been issued and delivered or for good cause has been refused.</p>

<p>2. Service Oklahoma may issue or authorize the issuance of a temporary identification card to an applicant, permitting the holder the privileges otherwise granted by identification cards, while a permanent driver license is being provided and delivered to the applicant. Such card shall be invalid when the applicants permanent identification card has been issued and delivered, or for good cause has been refused.</p>

<p>C. 1. Service Oklahoma may issue a restricted commercial driver license to drivers eighteen (18) years of age or older for any of the following specific farm-related service industries:</p>

<p>a. farm retail outlets and suppliers,</p>

<p>b. agri-chemical businesses,</p>

<p>c. custom harvesters, and</p>

<p>d. livestock feeders.</p>

<p>The applicant shall have held a valid driver license for at least one (1) year. Applicants with more than two (2) years of driving experience shall have a good driving record for the most recent two-year period and shall meet all the requirements for a commercial driver license. The restricted commercial driver license shall not exceed the maximum total days that federal law allows. Applicants for the restricted commercial driver license shall be exempt from the knowledge and skills test. Application of the restricted commercial driver license does not have to be used in consecutive days. The use of the permit shall be declared at application.</p>

<p>2. A good driving record as used in this subsection shall mean an applicant:</p>

<p>a. has not had more than one license,</p>

<p>b. has not had any license suspended, revoked, or canceled,</p>

<p>c. has not had any conviction for any type of disqualifying offenses or serious traffic violations, or</p>

<p>d. has not had any conviction for a violation of state or local law relating to motor vehicle traffic control, other than a parking violation, arising in connection with any traffic accident and has no record of an accident in which he or she is at fault.</p>

<p>3. The restricted commercial driver license shall not be valid for operators of commercial motor vehicles beyond one hundred fifty (150) miles from the place of business or the farm currently being served. Such license shall be limited to Class B or C vehicles. Holders of such licenses who transport hazardous materials which are required to be placarded shall be limited to the following:</p>

<p>a. diesel fuel in quantities of one thousand (1,000) gallons or less,</p>

<p>b. liquid fertilizers in vehicles with total capacities of three thousand (3,000) gallons or less, and</p>

<p>c. solid fertilizers that are not mixed with any organic substance.</p>

<p>No other placarded hazardous materials shall be transported by holders of such licenses.</p>

<p>D. 1. Service Oklahoma may issue a non-domiciled commercial learner permit or a non-domiciled commercial driver license.</p>

<p>2. A person applying for such permit or license must comply with all testing and licensing requirements in accordance with applicable federal regulations, state laws, and Service Oklahoma rules. The expiration of the issued license shall be the same date as the expiration of the visa for the non-domiciled worker. Service Oklahoma may promulgate rules for the implementation of the process to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

<p>3. A person holding a non-domiciled commercial driver license or non-domiciled commercial learners permit within this state shall also possess a valid work visa and provide proof of citizenship to validate his or her identity while operating a commercial motor vehicle. Proof of citizenship shall be demonstrated through presentation of a birth certificate, naturalization certificate, or valid passport.</p>

<p>4. A commercial motor carrier whose driver is found to be in violation of this subsection shall be subject to a fine in the amount of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) for each violation. The proceeds of any penalties collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in the Weigh Station Improvement Revolving Fund created in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440182">Section 1167 of Title 47</a>&nbsp;of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>5. A driver found to be in violation of this subsection shall be prohibited from operating a commercial motor vehicle within this state until such a time that the driver is able to meet the identification provisions of this subsection. Any driver found to be operating a motor vehicle within this state while under such prohibition shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Any fine collected pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be deposited to the Trauma Care Assistance Revolving Fund created in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439702">Section 1-2530.9 of Title 63</a>&nbsp;of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>6. The commercial motor carrier shall be notified of the location of any commercial motor vehicle involved in a violation, and, upon payment of the fine in full and presentation of a driver who meets all requirements to operate a commercial motor vehicle within this state, shall take possession of the vehicle. If the commercial motor carrier is unable to either pay such fine or present such driver within twelve (12) hours after notification, the owner of any cargo being transported by the commercial motor vehicle shall be notified and allowed to arrange for the transfer of the cargo to another vehicle. Neither the state nor the owner of such cargo shall be liable for any reasonable action to transfer such cargo.</p>

<p>7. As used in this subsection, a non-domiciled commercial driver license or non-domiciled commercial learner permit shall have the same meaning as that provided in 49 C.F.R., Section 383.5.</p>

<p>E. 1. Service Oklahoma shall develop a procedure whereby a person applying for an original, renewal or replacement Class A, B, C or D driver license or identification card who is required to register as a convicted sex offender with the Department of Corrections pursuant to the provisions of the Sex Offenders Registration Act and who the Department of Corrections designates as an aggravated or habitual offender pursuant to subsection J of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=84016">Section 584 of Title 57</a>&nbsp;of the Oklahoma Statutes&nbsp;shall be issued a license or card bearing the words Sex Offender.</p>

<p>2. Service Oklahoma shall notify every person subject to registration under the provisions of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=81885">Section 1-101</a>&nbsp;et seq. of this title who holds a current Class A, B, C or D driver license or identification card that such person is required to surrender the license or card to Service Oklahoma within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the notice.</p>

<p>3. Upon surrendering the license or card for the reason set forth in this subsection, application may be made with Service Oklahoma for a replacement license or card bearing the words Sex Offender.</p>

<p>4. Failure to comply with the requirements set forth in such notice shall result in cancellation of the persons license or card. Such cancellation shall be in effect for one (1) year, after which time the person may make application with Service Oklahoma for a new license or card bearing the words Sex Offender. Continued use of a canceled license or card shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punishable by a fine of not less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00), nor more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00). When an individual is no longer required to register as a convicted sex offender with the Department of Corrections pursuant to the provisions of the Sex Offenders Registration Act, the individual shall be eligible to receive a driver license or identification card which does not bear the words Sex Offender.</p>

<p>F. Nothing in subsection E of this section shall be deemed to impose any liability upon or give rise to a cause of action against any employee, agent or official of the Department of Corrections for failing to designate a sex offender as an aggravated or habitual offender pursuant to subsection J of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=84016">Section 584 of Title 57</a>&nbsp;of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>G. A person subject to an order for the installation of an ignition interlock device shall be required by Service Oklahoma to submit his or her driver license for a replacement. The replacement driver license shall bear the words Interlock Required and such designation shall remain on the driver license for the duration of the order requiring the ignition interlock device. The replacement license shall be subject to the same expiration and renewal procedures provided by law. Upon completion of the requirements for the interlock device, a person may apply for a replacement driver license.</p>

<p>H. Service Oklahoma shall develop a procedure whereby a person applying for an original, renewal or replacement Class D driver license who has been granted modified driving privileges under this title shall be issued a Class D driver license which identifies the license as a modified license.</p>

Service Oklahoma shall notify every person subject to registration under the provisions of Section 1-101 et seq. of this title who holds a current Class A, B, C or D driver license or identification card that such person is required to surrender the license or card to Service Oklahoma within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the notice.</p>

<p>3. Upon surrendering the license or card for the reason set forth in this subsection, application may be made with Service Oklahoma for a replacement license or card bearing the words "Sex Offender".</p>

<p>4. Failure to comply with the requirements set forth in such notice shall result in cancellation of the person's license or card. Such cancellation shall be in effect for one (1) year, after which time the person may make application with Service Oklahoma for a new license or card bearing the words "Sex Offender". Continued use of a canceled license or card shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punishable by a fine of not less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00), nor more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00).

<p>G. A person subject to an order for the installation of an ignition interlock device shall be required by Service Oklahoma to submit his or her driver license for a replacement. The replacement driver license shall bear the words "Interlock Required" and such designation shall remain on the driver license for the duration of the order requiring the ignition interlock device.

Upon completion of the requirements for the interlock device, a person may apply for a replacement driver license.</p>

<p>H. Service Oklahoma shall develop a procedure whereby a person applying for an original, renewal or replacement Class D driver license who has been granted modified driving privileges under this title shall be issued a Class D driver license which identifies the license as a modified license.</p>
