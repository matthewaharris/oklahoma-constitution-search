<p>2. The monies apportioned pursuant to subparagraphs a through e of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be apportioned as follows: forty percent (40%) of such sum shall be distributed to the various counties in that proportion which the county road mileage of each county bears to the entire state road mileage as certified by the Transportation Commission and the remaining sixty percent (60%) of such sum shall be distributed to the various counties on the basis which the population and area of each county bears to the total population and area of the state. The population shall be as shown by the last Federal Decennial Census or the most recent annual estimate provided by the United States Bureau of the Census. The funds shall be used for the purpose of constructing and maintaining county highways; provided, however, the county treasurer may deposit so much of the funds in the sinking fund as may be necessary for the retirement of interest and annual accrual of indebtedness created by the issuance of county or township bonds for road purposes. Such deposits to the sinking fund shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the funds allocated to a county pursuant to this paragraph.</p>

<p>F. 1.

<p>d. for the year beginning July 1, 2015, through the year ending on June 30, 2019, two and fifty-nine one-hundredths percent (2.59%), but in no event shall the amount apportioned in any fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the total amount apportioned for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2015. Any amounts in excess of such limitation shall be placed to the credit of the General Revenue Fund, and</p>

<p>e. for the year beginning July 1, 2019, and all subsequent years, two and fifty-nine one-hundredths percent (2.59%), but in no event shall the amount apportioned in any fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the total amount apportioned for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2015. Any amounts in excess of such limitation shall be placed to the credit of the Rebuilding Oklahoma Access and Driver Safety Fund created in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=443764">Section 1521 of Title 69</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>2. The monies apportioned pursuant to subparagraphs a through e of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be used for the primary purpose of matching federal funds for the construction of federal aid projects on county roads, or constructing and maintaining county or township highways and permanent bridges of such counties. The distribution of monies apportioned by this paragraph shall be made upon the basis of the current formula based upon road mileage, area and population as related to county road improvement and maintenance costs. Provided, however, the Department of Transportation may update the formula factors from time to time as necessary to account for changing conditions.</p>

<p>G. 1. The following percentages of the monies referred to in subsection A of this section shall be transmitted by Service Oklahoma to the various counties as set forth in paragraph 2 of this subsection:</p>

<p>b. for the year beginning July 1, 2001, and ending June 30, 2002, three and fifty-nine one-hundredths percent (3.59%),</p>

<p>c. for the year beginning July 1, 2002, through the year ending on June 30, 2015, three and sixty-two one-hundredths percent (3.62%),</p>

<p>d. for the year beginning July 1, 2015, through the year ending on June 30, 2019, three and sixty-two one-hundredths percent (3.62%), but in no event shall the amount apportioned in any fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the total amount apportioned for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2015.

<p>2. The monies apportioned pursuant to subparagraphs a through e of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be transmitted to the various counties on the basis of a formula to be developed by the Department of Transportation. Such formula shall be similar to that currently used for the distribution of County Bridge Program Funds, but also taking into consideration the effect of terrain and traffic volume as related to county road improvement and maintenance costs. Provided, however, the Department of Transportation may update the formula factors from time to time as necessary to account for changing conditions. The funds shall be transmitted to the various county treasurers to be deposited in the county highway fund of their respective counties.</p>

<p>2. The monies apportioned pursuant to subparagraphs a through e of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be apportioned to the various counties based upon the proportion that each countys population bears to the total state population.</p>

<p>Each countys allocation of funds shall be remitted to the various county treasurers to be deposited in the general fund of the county and used for the support of county government.</p>

<p>I. 1. The following percentages of the monies referred to in subsection A of this section shall be apportioned to the various cities and incorporated towns as set forth in paragraph 2 of this subsection:</p>

<p>a. from October 1, 2000, until June 30, 2001, three and four one-hundredths percent (3.04%),</p>
