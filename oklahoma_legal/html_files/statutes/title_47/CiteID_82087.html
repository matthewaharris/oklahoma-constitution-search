<p>d. The licensed operator shall process the approved REAL ID Compliant or REAL ID Noncompliant Driver License or Identification Card application and upon payment shall provide the applicant a temporary driver license or identification card. A temporary driver license or identification card shall afford the holder the privileges otherwise granted by the specific class of driver license or identification card for the period of time listed on the temporary driver license or identification card or the period of time prior to the applicant receiving a REAL ID Compliant or REAL ID Noncompliant Driver License or Identification Card, whichever time period is shorter.</p>

<p>3. REAL ID Compliant Driver License and Identification Card Renewal and Replacement:</p>

<p>a.

A licensed operator may process the voluntary downgrade of a REAL ID Compliant Commercial Driver License to any lower class license upon request of the licensee; provided, no additional endorsements or restrictions are placed on the license.</p>

<p>b. Service Oklahoma employees or authorized licensed operators shall perform all document recognition and other requirements needed for approval of a renewal or replacement REAL ID Compliant Driver License or Identification Card application.</p>

<p>c. Upon approval of a renewal or replacement REAL ID Compliant Driver License or Identification Card application, the applicant may receive a temporary driver license or identification card from Service Oklahoma or an authorized licensed operator.</p>

<p>d.

<p>e. For purposes of this title, an application for a REAL ID Compliant Driver License or Identification Card by an individual with a valid Oklahoma-issued driver license or identification card shall be considered a renewal of a REAL ID Compliant Driver License or Identification Card.</p>

<p>4. REAL ID Noncompliant Driver License and Identification Card Renewal and Replacement:</p>

<p>a. Application for renewal or replacement of a REAL ID Noncompliant Driver License or Identification Card may be made to Service Oklahoma or to a licensed operator. A licensed operator may process the voluntary downgrade of a REAL ID Noncompliant Commercial Driver License to any lower class license upon request of the licensee; provided, no additional endorsements or restrictions are added to the license.</p>

<p>b. Service Oklahoma employees or licensed operators shall perform all document recognition and other requirements needed for approval of a renewal or replacement REAL ID Noncompliant Driver License or Identification Card application.</p>

<p>c. Upon approval of a renewal or replacement REAL ID Noncompliant Driver License or Identification Card application, the applicant may receive a temporary driver license or identification card from Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator.</p>

<p>3. REAL ID Compliant Driver License and Identification Card Renewal and Replacement:</p>

<p>a.

<p>b. Service Oklahoma employees or authorized licensed operators shall perform all document recognition and other requirements needed for approval of a renewal or replacement REAL ID Compliant Driver License or Identification Card application.</p>
