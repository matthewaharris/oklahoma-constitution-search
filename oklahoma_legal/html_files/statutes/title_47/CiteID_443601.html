The identification cards shall be issued, renewed, replaced, canceled and denied in the same manner as driver licenses in this state. A licensee whose record reflects a notation of the person's proof of legal presence, verified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or proof of U.S. citizenship, may obtain a REAL ID Compliant Identification Card or a Noncompliant Identification Card from a motor license agent or the Department of Public Safety, regardless of the status of the license held by the licensee. Provided, the licensee must comply with all REAL ID documentation requirements to obtain a REAL ID Compliant Identification Card.

The Tax Commission shall develop procedures for claims for reimbursement.</p>

<p>G. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a person makes application for a new identification card, or makes application to renew an identification card, and the person has been convicted of, or received a deferred judgment for, any offense required to register pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act, the identification card shall be valid for a period of one (1) year from the month of issuance, but may be renewed yearly during the time the person is subject to registration on the Sex Offender Registry. The cost for such identification card shall be the same as for other identification cards and renewals.</p>

<p>H. Nothing in this section requires or authorizes the Department of Public Safety to issue a REAL ID Noncompliant Identification Card without the documentation required by the provisions of paragraph 9 of subsection A of Section 6-103 of this title.</p>
