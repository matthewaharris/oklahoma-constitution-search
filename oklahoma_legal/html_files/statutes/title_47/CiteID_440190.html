<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. All information contained in certificates of title, applications therefor, vehicle registration records, records related to boats and motors, and computer data files is hereby declared to be confidential information and shall not be copied by anyone or disclosed to anyone other than employees of Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission in the regular course of their employment, except as provided in subsection B of this section. As used in this section, personal information means information that identifies an individual including name, address (excluding the five-digit ZIP code) and telephone number, but does not include information on vehicular accidents, driving violations and drivers status.</p>

<p>B. Personal information referred to in subsection A of this section shall be disclosed for use in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft, motor vehicle emissions, motor vehicle product alterations, recalls or advisories, and removal of non-owner records from the original owner records of motor vehicle manufacturers to carry out the purpose of Titles I and IV of the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, the Automobile Information Disclosure Act (15 U.S.C., Section 1231 et seq.), the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C., Section 7401 et seq.) and Chapters 301, 305 and 321-331 of Title 49 of the United States Code and may be disclosed as follows:</p>

<p>1. For use by any governmental agency, including but not limited to any court or law enforcement agency, in carrying out its functions, or any private person or entity acting on behalf of a federal, state or local governmental agency in carrying out its functions. Information relating to motor vehicle insurance, including the insurer and insurance policy numbers, may be released to law enforcement officers investigating an accident pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82248">Section 10-104</a> of this title;</p>

<p>2. For use by any motor vehicle manufacturer or an authorized representative thereof in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft, motor vehicle emissions, motor vehicle product alterations, recalls or advisories, performance monitoring of motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts and dealers, motor vehicle market research activities, including survey research, and removal of non-owner records from the original owner records of motor vehicle manufacturers. The confidentiality of the information shall be protected, as set out above, and used only for the purpose stated; provided, further, that Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall be authorized to review the use of and the measures employed to safeguard the information; and provided, further, that the manufacturer or representative shall bear the cost incurred by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission in the production of the information requested. If the confidentiality provisions, as set out above, are violated, the provisions of subsection D of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440444">Section 205 of Title 68</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes shall apply and the privilege of obtaining information shall be terminated. Any manufacturer or representative violating the provisions of this paragraph, upon conviction, shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00);</p>

<p>3. For use by any person compiling and publishing motor vehicle statistics, provided that such statistics do not disclose the names and addresses of individuals. Such information shall be provided upon payment of a reasonable fee as determined by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission;</p>

<p>4. For use by a wrecker or towing service licensed pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440008">Section 951</a> et seq. of this title for use in providing notice to the owners and secured parties of towed or impounded vehicles, upon payment of a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per vehicle record page to Service Oklahoma, the Corporation Commission or any licensed operator;</p>

<p>5. For use by a legitimate business or its agents, employees, or contractors for use in the normal course of business, upon payment of a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per vehicle record page to Service Oklahoma, the Corporation Commission or any licensed operator, but only:</p>

<p>a. to verify the accuracy of personal information submitted by the individual to whom the information pertains to the business or its agents, employees, or contractors, or</p>

<p>b. to obtain the correct information, if such information submitted by the individual to whom the information pertains to the business is not correct, or is no longer correct, but only for the purposes of preventing fraud by, pursuing legal remedies against, or recovering on a debt or security interest against the individual;</p>

<p>6. For use in connection with any civil, criminal, administrative or arbitral proceeding in any federal, state or local court or agency or before any self-regulatory body, including the service of process, investigation in anticipation of litigation, and the execution or enforcement of judgments and orders, or pursuant to an order of a federal, state or local court, upon payment of a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per vehicle record page to Service Oklahoma, the Corporation Commission or any licensed operator;</p>

<p>7. For use by any insurer or insurance support organization, or by a self-insured entity, or its agents, employees, or contractors, in connection with claims investigation activities, anti-fraud activities, rating or underwriting, upon payment of a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per vehicle record page to Service Oklahoma, the Corporation Commission or any licensed operator;</p>

<p>8. For use by any licensed private investigative agency or licensed security service for any purpose permitted under this subsection, upon payment of a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per vehicle record page to Service Oklahoma, the Corporation Commission or any licensed operator;</p>

<p>9. For use by a requester, upon payment of a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per vehicle record page to Service Oklahoma, the Corporation Commission or any licensed operator, if the requester demonstrates that it has obtained the written consent of the individual to whom the information pertains;</p>

<p>10. For use in connection with the operation of private toll transportation facilities; or</p>

<p>11. For furnishing the name and address of all commercial entities who have current registrations of any particular model of vehicle; provided, this exception shall not allow the release of personal information pursuant to the provisions of the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, 18 U.S.C., Sections 2721 through 2725.</p>

<p>Service Oklahoma shall collect a reasonable fee to recover the costs of providing the data. As used in this section, the term vehicle record page means a computer-generated printout of the motor vehicle inquiry screen. Information provided on the motor vehicle inquiry screen printout shall include the current vehicle owner name and address, vehicle make, model and year, identifying numbers for the vehicle license plate, certificate of title and vehicle identification number, relevant dates relating to the vehicle registration and certificate of title, lienholder information and lien status.</p>

<p>C. In addition to the information provided on the vehicle record page, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission may, upon written request, release to any requester authorized by the provisions of this section to obtain individual motor vehicle information, corresponding copies of vehicle certificates of title, applications therefor, vehicle registration records and computer data files.</p>

<p>There shall be an informational search and retrieval fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) per vehicle computer record search. If Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission performs a manual search, the fee shall be Seven Dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) per vehicle. Service Oklahoma is authorized to promulgate rules whereby licensed operators, when requesting such documentation in the performance of their duties, are exempt from this retrieval fee. Certified copies of vehicle certificates of title and applications therefor shall be included within the informational search and retrieval by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission for a fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00). Such duly certified copies may be received in evidence with the same effect as the original when the original is not in the possession or under the control of the party desiring to use the same.</p>

<p>D. Requesters authorized by this section to receive information shall submit to Service Oklahoma, the Corporation Commission or any licensed operator an affidavit supported by such documentation as Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission may require, on a form prescribed by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission certifying that the information is requested for a lawful and legitimate purpose and will not be further disseminated.</p>

<p>E. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission may allow the release of information from its motor vehicle records upon magnetic tape consisting only of the following information:</p>

<p>1. The date of the certificate of title;</p>

<p>2. The certificate of title number;</p>

<p>3. The type of title issued for the vehicle;</p>

<p>4. The odometer reading from the certificate of title;</p>

<p>5. The year in which the vehicle was manufactured;</p>

<p>6. The vehicle identification number for the vehicle;</p>

<p>7. The make of the vehicle; and</p>

<p>8. The location in which the vehicle is registered.</p>

<p>Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall allow the release of such information upon payment of a reasonable fee to be determined by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission. The information released as authorized by this subsection may only be used for purposes of detecting odometer rollback or odometer tampering, for determining the issuance in this state or any other state of salvage or rebuilt titles for vehicles or for determining whether a vehicle has been reported stolen in this state or any other state.</p>

<p>F. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440444">Section 205 of Title 68</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission may inform a secured party that taxes and fees are delinquent with respect to a vehicle upon which the secured party has a perfected lien.</p>

<p>G. Fees received by a licensed operator pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be included in the maximum sum that may be retained by licensed operators as compensation pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83099">Section 1143</a> of this title.</p>

<p>H. All funds collected by the Tax Commission pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Revolving Fund. Beginning January 1, 2023, all funds collected by Service Oklahoma pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deposited in the Service Oklahoma Revolving Fund. All funds collected by the Corporation Commission pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be apportioned as provided in subsection C of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83115">Section 1161</a> of this title.</p>

<p>I. It is further provided that the provisions of this section shall be strictly interpreted and shall not be construed as permitting the disclosure of any other information contained in the files and records of Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission.</p>

<p>J. It shall be unlawful for any person to commit any of the following acts:</p>

<p>1. To knowingly obtain or disclose personal information from a motor vehicle record for any use not expressly permitted by this section; or</p>

<p>2. To make false representation to obtain any personal information from an individuals motor vehicle record.</p>

<p>Any violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by the imposition of a fine not exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding one (1) year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Where applicable, a person convicted of a violation of the provisions of this section shall be removed or dismissed from office or state employment. No liability whatsoever, civil or criminal, shall attach to any member or employee of Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission for any error or omission in the disclosure of such information.</p>
