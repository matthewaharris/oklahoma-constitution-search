<p>C. Any person:</p>

<p>1. Who is at least fifteen (15) years of age and is currently receiving instruction in or has successfully completed driver education. For purposes of this section, the term "driver education" shall mean:</p>

<p>a. a prescribed secondary school driver education course, as provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=90397">Sections 19-113</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=90405">19-121 of Title 70</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes,</p>

<p>b. a driver education course, certified by Service Oklahoma, from a parochial, private, or other nonpublic secondary school,</p>

<p>c. a commercial driver training course, as defined by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82967">Sections 801</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82974">808</a> of this title,</p>

<p>d. a parent-taught driver education course, certified by Service of Oklahoma, in conjunction with the Department of Public Safety. Service Oklahoma shall promulgate rules for any parent-taught driver education course, or</p>

<p>2. Who is at least sixteen (16) years of age,</p>

<p>may, upon successfully passing all parts of the driver license examination administered by Service Oklahoma, or an approved written examination proctor, except the driving examination, be issued a learner permit which will grant the permittee the privilege to operate a Class D motor vehicle upon the public highways only between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. and while accompanied by a licensed driver who is at least twenty-one (21) years of age and who is actually occupying a seat beside the permittee; provided, the written examination for a learner permit may be waived by Service Oklahoma upon verification that the person has successfully completed driver education.</p>

<p>D. 1. Any person:</p>

<p>a. who has applied for, been issued, and has possessed a learner permit for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days,</p>

<p>b. whose custodial legal parent or legal guardian certifies to Service Oklahoma by sworn affidavit that the person has received a minimum of fifty (50) hours of actual behind-the-wheel training, of which at least ten (10) hours of such training was at night, from a licensed driver who was at least twenty-one (21) years of age and who was properly licensed to operate a Class D motor vehicle for a minimum of two (2) years, and</p>

<p>c. who is at least sixteen (16) years of age,</p>

<p>may be issued an intermediate Class D license upon successfully passing all parts of the driver license examinations administered by Service Oklahoma; provided, the written examination, if it has not previously been administered or waived, may be waived by Service Oklahoma upon verification that the person has successfully completed driver education or the driving examination may be waived by Service Oklahoma upon successful passage of the examination administered by a certified designated examiner, as provided for in Section 6-110 of this title. However, notwithstanding the date of issuance of the learner permit, if the person has been convicted of a traffic offense which is reported on the driving record of that person, the time period specified in subparagraph a of this paragraph shall be recalculated to begin from the date of conviction for the traffic offense, and must elapse before that person may be issued an intermediate Class D license. If the person has been convicted of more than one traffic offense which is reported on the driving record of that person, the time period specified in subparagraph a of this paragraph shall be recalculated to begin from the most recent date of conviction, and must elapse before that person may be issued an intermediate Class D license.</p>

<p>2. A person who has been issued an intermediate Class D license under the provisions of this subsection:</p>

<p>a. shall be granted the privilege to operate a Class D motor vehicle upon the public highways:</p>

<p>(1) only between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except for driving to and from work, school, school activities, and church activities, or</p>

<p>(2) at any time, if a licensed driver who is at least twenty-one (21) years of age is actually occupying a seat beside the intermediate Class D licensee, or if the intermediate Class D licensee is a farm or ranch resident, and is operating a motor vehicle while engaged in farming or ranching operations outside the limits of a municipality, or driving to and from work, school, school activities, or church activities, and</p>

<p>b. shall not operate a motor vehicle with more than one passenger unless:</p>

<p>(1) all passengers live in the same household as the custodial legal parent or legal guardian, or</p>

<p>(2) a licensed driver at least twenty-one (21) years of age is actually occupying a seat beside the intermediate Class D licensee.</p>

<p>E. Any person who has been issued an intermediate Class D license for a minimum of:</p>

<p>1. One (1) year; or</p>

<p>2. One hundred eighty (180) days, if the person has completed both the driver education and the parent-certified behind-the-wheel training provisions of subparagraph b of paragraph 1 of subsection D of this section,</p>

<p>may be issued a Class D license. However, notwithstanding the date of issuance of the Class D license, if the person has been convicted of a traffic offense which is reported on the driving record of that person, the time periods specified in paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection, as applicable, shall be recalculated to begin from the date of conviction for the traffic offense, and must elapse before that person may be issued a Class D license. If the person has been convicted of more than one traffic offense which is reported on the driving record of that person, the time periods specified in paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection, as applicable, shall be recalculated to begin from the most recent date of conviction, and must elapse before that person may be issued a Class D license.</p>

<p>F. Learner permits and intermediate Class D licenses shall be issued for the same period as all other driver licenses. The licenses may be suspended or canceled at the discretion of the Department of Public Safety, with notice to Service Oklahoma, for violation of restrictions, for failing to give the required or correct information on the application, for knowingly giving false or inaccurate information on the application or any subsequent documentation related to the granting of driving privileges, for using a hand-held electronic device while operating a motor vehicle for non-life-threatening emergency purposes or for violation of any traffic laws of this state pertaining to the operation of a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>G. Service Oklahoma shall promulgate rules establishing procedures for removal of learner permit and intermediate Class D license restrictions from the permit or license upon the permittee or licensee qualifying for a less restricted or an unrestricted license.</p>

<p>H. Any person fourteen (14) years of age or older may apply for a restricted Class D license with a motorcycle-only restriction. After the person has successfully passed all parts of the motorcycle examination other than the driving examination, has successfully completed a certified state-approved motorcycle basic rider course approved by the Department of Public Safety, in conjunction with Service Oklahoma, and has met all requirements provided for in the rules of the Department and Service Oklahoma, Service Oklahoma shall issue to the person a restricted Class D license with a motorcycle-only restriction which shall grant to the person, while having the license in the person's immediate possession, the privilege to operate a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle:</p>

<p>1. With a piston displacement not to exceed three hundred (300) cubic centimeters;</p>

<p>2. Between the hours of 4:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. only;</p>

<p>3. While wearing approved protective headgear; and</p>

<p>4. While accompanied by and receiving instruction from any person who is at least twenty-one (21) years of age and who is properly licensed pursuant to the laws of this state to operate a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, and who has visual contact with the restricted licensee.</p>

<p>The restricted licensee may apply on or after thirty (30) days from date of issuance of the restricted Class D license with a motorcycle-only restriction to have the restriction of being accompanied by a licensed driver removed by successfully completing the driving portion of an examination.</p>

<p>The written examination and driving examination for a restricted Class D license with a motorcycle-only endorsement shall be waived by Service Oklahoma upon verification that the person has successfully completed a certified state-approved motorcycle basic rider course approved by the Department and Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>I. Service Oklahoma may in its discretion issue a special permit to any person who has attained the age of fourteen (14) years, authorizing such person to operate farm vehicles between the farm and the market to haul commodities grown on the farm; provided, that the special permit shall be temporary and shall expire not more than thirty (30) days after the issuance of the special permit. Special permits shall be issued only to farm residents and shall be issued only during the time of the harvest of the principal crops grown on such farm. Provided, however, Service Oklahoma shall not issue a special permit pursuant to this subsection until Service Oklahoma is fully satisfied after the examination of the application and other evidence furnished in support thereof, that the person is physically and mentally developed to such a degree that the operation of a motor vehicle by the person would not be inimical to public safety.</p>

<p>b. shall not operate a motor vehicle with more than one passenger unless:</p>

<p>(1) all passengers live in the same household as the custodial legal parent or legal guardian, or</p>

<p>(2) a licensed driver at least twenty-one (21) years of age is actually occupying a seat beside the intermediate Class D licensee.</p>

<p>H. Any person fourteen (14) years of age or older may apply for a restricted Class D license with a motorcycle-only restriction. After the person has successfully passed all parts of the motorcycle examination other than the driving examination, has successfully completed a certified state-approved motorcycle basic rider course approved by the Department of Public Safety, in conjunction with Service Oklahoma, and has met all requirements provided for in the rules of the Department and Service Oklahoma, Service Oklahoma shall issue to the person a restricted Class D license with a motorcycle-only restriction which shall grant to the person, while having the license in the persons immediate possession, the privilege to operate a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle:</p>

<p>1. With a piston displacement not to exceed three hundred (300) cubic centimeters;</p>

<p>The written examination and driving examination for a restricted Class D license with a motorcycle-only endorsement shall be waived by Service Oklahoma upon verification that the person has successfully completed a certified state-approved motorcycle basic rider course approved by the Department and Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>I.

Special permits shall be issued only to farm residents and shall be issued only during the time of the harvest of the principal crops grown on such farm. Provided, however, Service Oklahoma shall not issue a special permit pursuant to this subsection until Service Oklahoma is fully satisfied after the examination of the application and other evidence furnished in support thereof, that the person is physically and mentally developed to such a degree that the operation of a motor vehicle by the person would not be inimical to public safety.</p>
