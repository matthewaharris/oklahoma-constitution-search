<p><em><strong>Multiple Amendments Enacted During the 2024 Legislative Session</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Version 1 (Amended by Laws 2022, HB 3419, c. 282, § 127, emerg. eff. May 19, 2022; Amended by Laws 2024, SB 2038, c. 452, § 72, emerg. eff. June 14, 2024)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>A. 1. Except for all-terrain vehicles, utility vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively off roads and highways, upon the filing of a registration application and the payment of the fees provided for in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, shall assign to the vehicle described in the application a distinctive number, and issue to the owner of the vehicle a certificate of registration, one license plate and a yearly decal. Service Oklahoma shall assign an all-terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways a distinctive number and issue to the owner a certificate of registration and a decal but not a license plate. For each subsequent registration year, Service Oklahoma shall issue a yearly decal to be affixed to the license plate, except for an all-terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways. The initial decal for an all-terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle shall be attached to the front of the vehicle and shall be in clear view. The decal shall be on the front or on the front fork of the motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways and the decal shall be in clear view. The yearly decal shall have an identification number and the last two numbers of the registration year for which it shall expire. Except as provided by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83050">Section 1113A</a> of this title, the license plate shall be affixed to the exterior of the vehicle until a replacement license plate is applied for. If the owner applies for a replacement license plate, Service Oklahoma shall charge the fee provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83051">Section 1114</a> of this title. The yearly decal will validate the license plate for each registration period other than the year the license plate is issued. The license plate and decal shall be of such size, color, design and numbering as Service Oklahoma may direct. However, yearly decals issued to the owner of a vehicle who has filed an affidavit with the appropriate licensed operator in accordance with <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82235">Section 7-607</a> of this title shall be a separate and distinct color from all other decals issued under this section. Before the effective date of this act, Service Oklahoma shall also issue a monthly decal which shall include a two-letter abbreviation corresponding to the county in which the vehicle is registered. Service Oklahoma shall issue all decals in the possession of Service Oklahoma on the effective date of this act before issuing any decals which do not contain the county abbreviation.</p>

<p>2. a. The operation of a street-legal utility vehicle on the streets and highways of this state requires the vehicle be issued a certificate of registration and license plate to be renewed annually. Upon the filing of a registration application and the payment of the fees provided for in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, shall assign to the vehicle described in the application a distinctive number, and issue to the owner of the vehicle a certificate of registration, one license plate and a yearly decal. For each subsequent registration year, Service Oklahoma shall issue a yearly decal to be affixed to the license plate. The initial decal for a street-legal utility vehicle shall be attached to the front of the vehicle and shall be in clear view. The yearly decal shall have an identification number and the last two numbers of the registration year for which it shall expire. Except as provided by Section 1113A of this title, the license plate shall be affixed to the exterior of the vehicle until a replacement license plate is issued. If the owner applies for a replacement license plate, Service Oklahoma shall charge the fee provided for in Section 1114 of this title. The yearly decal will validate the license plate for each registration period other than the year the license plate is issued. The license plate and decal shall be of such size, color, design and numbering as Service Oklahoma may direct. However, yearly decals issued to the owner of a vehicle who has filed an affidavit with the appropriate licensed operator in accordance with Section 7-607 of this title shall be a separate and distinct color from all other decals issued under this section.</p>

<p>b. Service Oklahoma shall design and issue a temporary tag to out-of-state owners of street-legal utility vehicles. The temporary tag shall be recognized in lieu of registration in this state. The temporary tag shall clearly indicate the date of issuance and the date of expiration, which shall be five (5) days, including the day of issuance. Upon application for a temporary tag, the out-of-state owner shall show proof of insurance coverage that satisfies the requirements of the Compulsory Insurance Law pursuant Section 7-600 et seq. of this title. Service Oklahoma is authorized to promulgate rules and procedures to implement the provisions of this paragraph.</p>

<p>3. a. The operation of a military surplus vehicle, as defined by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=492582">Section 1-133.1a</a> of this title, on the streets and highways of this state requires that the vehicle be issued a certificate of registration and license plate to be renewed annually. Upon the filing of a registration application and the payment of the fees provided for in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, shall design and assign license plates of a distinctive design in lieu of the usual license plates that shall show, in addition to the identification number, that the vehicle meets the qualifications of a military surplus vehicle, as the case may be, owned by an Oklahoma military surplus vehicle collector. The registration shall be valid for one (1) year and may be renewed by payment of such annual fee. The yearly decal shall have an identification number and the last two numbers of the registration year for which it shall expire. Except as provided by Section 1113A of this title, the license plate shall be affixed to the exterior of the vehicle until a replacement license plate is issued. If the owner applies for a replacement license plate, Service Oklahoma shall charge the fee provided for in Section 1114 of this title. The yearly decal will validate the license plate for each registration period other than the year the license plate is issued. The license plate and decal shall be of such size, color, design, and numbering as Service Oklahoma may direct. However, yearly decals issued to the owner of a vehicle who has filed an affidavit with the appropriate licensed operator in accordance with Section 7-607 of this title shall be a separate and distinct color from all other decals issued under this section.</p>

<p>b. Each military surplus vehicle collector, as defined by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=492584">Section 1-133.1b</a> of this title, who applies for military surplus vehicle license plates will be issued a military surplus collectors identification number that will appear on each license plate. Second and all subsequent registrations under this section by the same collector will bear the same collectors identification number followed by a suffix letter for vehicle identification.</p>

<p>c. A military surplus vehicle collector must own and have registered one or more vehicles with regular Oklahoma license plates that are used for regular transportation.</p>

<p>d. There shall be a one-time processing fee of Twenty Dollars ($20.00) to defray the cost of issuing the original military surplus vehicle collectors military surplus vehicle designation license plates to ensure that each collector will be issued only one collectors identification number.</p>

<p>4. The license plate shall be securely attached to the rear of the vehicle, except truck-tractor plates which shall be attached to the front of the vehicle. Service Oklahoma may, with the concurrence of the Department of Public Safety, by Joint Rule, change and direct the manner, place and location of display of any vehicle license plate when such action is deemed in the public interest. The license plate, decal and all letters and numbers shall be clearly visible at all times. The operation of a vehicle in this state, regardless of where such vehicle is registered, upon which the license plate is covered, overlaid or otherwise screened with any material, whether such material be clear, translucent, tinted or opaque, shall be a violation of this paragraph.</p>

<p>5. Upon payment of the annual registration fee provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440198">Section 1133</a> of this title, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, or a licensed operator may issue a permanent nonexpiring license plate to an owner of one hundred or more commercial motor vehicles and for vehicles registered under the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440194">Section 1120</a> of this title. Upon payment of the annual registration fee, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall issue a certificate of registration that shall be carried at all times in the vehicle for which it is issued. Provided, if the registrant submits its application through electronic means, such qualified owners of one hundred or more commercial motor vehicles, properly registered pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440198">Section 1133</a> of this title, may elect to receive a permanent certificate of registration that shall be carried at all times in the vehicle for which it is issued.</p>

<p>6. Every vehicle owned by an agency of this state shall be exempt from the payment of registration fees required by this title. Provided, such vehicle shall be registered and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act.</p>

<p>B. The license plates required under the provisions of this title shall conform to the requirements and specifications listed hereinafter:</p>

<p>1. Each license plate shall have a space for the placement of the yearly decals for each succeeding year of registration after the initial issue;</p>

<p>2. The provisions of the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act regarding the issuance of yearly decals shall not apply to the issuance of apportioned license plates, including license plates for state vehicles, and exempt plates for governmental entities and fire departments organized pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=66962">Section 592 of Title 18</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes;</p>

<p>3. All license plates and decals shall be made with reflectorized material as a background to the letters, numbers and characters displayed thereon. The reflectorized material shall be of such a nature as to provide effective and dependable brightness during the service period for which the license plate or decal is issued;</p>

<p>4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for all state vehicles. Such license plates shall be permanent in nature and designed in such manner as to remain with the vehicle for the duration of the vehicles life span or until the title is transferred to a nongovernmental owner;</p>

<p>5. Within the limits prescribed in this section, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for vehicles of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The license plates shall have the legend Oklahoma OK and shall contain the letters OHP followed by the state seal and the badge number of the Highway Patrol officer to whom the vehicle is assigned. The words Oklahoma Highway Patrol shall also be included on such license plates;</p>

<p>6. Within the limits prescribed in this section, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for vehicles of the Oklahoma Military Department. Such license plates shall have the legend Oklahoma OK and shall contain the letters OMD followed by the state seal and three numbers or letters as designated by the Adjutant General. The words Oklahoma Military Department shall also be included on such license plates;</p>

<p>7. Within the limits prescribed in this section, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for vehicles of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Such license plates shall contain the letters DOC followed by the Department of Corrections badge and three numbers or letters or combination of both as designated by the Director of the agency. The words Department of Corrections shall also be included on such license plates; and</p>

<p>8. Within the limits prescribed in this section, the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department shall design any license plates required by the initiation of a license plate reissuance by Service Oklahoma at the request of the Department of Public Safety pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=453245">Section 1113.2</a> of this title. Any such new designs shall be submitted by the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department to the Department of Public Safety for its approval prior to being issued by Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>C. Where the applicant has satisfactorily shown that the applicant owns the vehicle sought to be registered but is unable to produce documentary evidence of the ownership, a license plate may be issued upon approval by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable. In such instances the reason for not issuing a certificate of title shall be indicated on the receipt given to the applicant. It shall still be the duty of the applicant to immediately take all necessary steps to obtain the Oklahoma certificate of title and it shall be unlawful for the applicant to sell the vehicle until the certificate has been obtained in the applicants name.</p>

<p>D. The certificate of registration provided for in this section shall be in convenient form, and the certificate of registration, or a certified copy or photostatic copy thereof, duly authenticated by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, shall be carried at all times in or upon all vehicles so registered, in such manner as to permit a ready examination thereof upon demand by any peace officer of the state or duly authorized employee of the Department of Public Safety. Any such officer or agent may seize and hold such vehicle when the operator of the same does not have the registration certificate in the operators possession or when any such officer or agent determines that the registration certificate has been obtained by misrepresentation of any essential or material fact or when any number or identifying information appearing on such certificate has been changed, altered, obliterated or concealed in any way, until the proper registration or identification of such vehicle has been made or produced by the owner thereof.</p>

<p>E. The purchaser of a new or used manufactured home shall, within thirty (30) days of the date of purchase, register the home with Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83058">Section 1117</a> of this title. For a new manufactured home, it shall be the responsibility of the dealer selling the home to place a temporary license plate on the home in the same manner as provided in Section 1128 of this title for other new motor vehicles. For the first year that any manufactured home is registered in this state, Service Oklahoma shall issue a metal license plate which shall be affixed to the manufactured home. The temporary dealer license plate or the metal license plate shall be displayed on the manufactured home at all times when upon a public roadway; provided, a repossession affidavit issued pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438859">Sections 1110</a> and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83069">1126</a> of this title shall be permissible in lieu of a current license plate and decal for the purposes of removing a repossessed manufactured home to a secure location. Manufactured homes previously registered and subject to ad valorem taxation as provided by law shall have a decal affixed at the time ad valorem taxes are paid for such manufactured home; provided, for a manufactured home permanently affixed to real estate, no decal or license plate shall be required to be affixed and the owner thereof shall be given a receipt upon payment of ad valorem taxes due on the home. Service Oklahoma shall make sufficient plates and decals available to the various licensed operators of the state in order for an owner of a manufactured home to acquire the plate or decal. A one-dollar fee shall be charged for issuance of any plate or decal. The fee shall be apportioned each month to the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury.</p>

<p>F. The decal shall be easily visible for purposes of verification by a county assessor that the manufactured home is properly assessed for ad valorem taxation. In the first year of registration, a decal shall be issued for placement on the license plate indicating payment of applicable registration fees and excise taxes. A duplicate manufactured home registration decal shall be affixed inside the window nearest the front door of the manufactured home. In the second and all subsequent years for which the manufactured home is subject to ad valorem taxation, an annual decal shall be affixed inside the window nearest the front door as evidence of payment of ad valorem taxes. Service Oklahoma shall issue decals to the various county treasurers of the state in order for a manufactured home owner to obtain such decal each year. Upon presentation of a valid ad valorem tax receipt, the manufactured home owner shall be issued the annual decal.</p>

<p>G. Upon the registration of a manufactured home in this state for the first time or upon discovery of a manufactured home previously registered within this state for which the information required by this subsection is not known, Service Oklahoma shall obtain:</p>

<p>1. The name of the owner of the manufactured home;</p>

<p>2. The serial number or identification number of the manufactured home;</p>

<p>3. A legal description or address of the location for the home;</p>

<p>4. The actual retail selling price of the manufactured home excluding Oklahoma taxes;</p>

<p>5. The certificate of title number for the home; and</p>

<p>6. Any other information which Service Oklahoma deems to be necessary.</p>

<p>The application for registration shall also include the school district in which the manufactured home is located or is to be located. The information shall be entered into a computer data system which shall be used by Service Oklahoma to provide information to county assessors upon request by the assessor. The assessor may request any information from the system in order to properly assess a manufactured home for ad valorem taxation.</p>

<p>A. 1. Except for all-terrain vehicles, utility vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively off roads and highways, upon the filing of a registration application and the payment of the fees provided for in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, shall assign to the vehicle described in the application a distinctive number, and issue to the owner of the vehicle a certificate of registration, one license plate and a yearly decal, unless otherwise previously issued pursuant to the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act. Service Oklahoma shall assign an all-terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways a distinctive number and issue to the owner a certificate of registration and a decal but not a license plate. For each subsequent registration year, Service Oklahoma shall issue a yearly decal to be affixed to the license plate, except for an all-terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways. The initial decal for an all-terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle shall be attached to the front of the vehicle and shall be in clear view. The decal shall be on the front or on the front fork of the motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways and the decal shall be in clear view. The yearly decal shall have an identification number and the last two numbers of the registration year for which it shall expire. Except as provided by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83050">Section 1113A</a> of this title, the license plate shall be affixed to the exterior of the vehicle until a replacement license plate is applied for. If the owner applies for a replacement license plate, Service Oklahoma shall charge the fee provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83051">Section 1114</a> of this title. The yearly decal will validate the license plate for each registration period other than the year the license plate is issued. The license plate and decal shall be of such size, color, design, and numbering as Service Oklahoma may direct. However, yearly decals issued to the owner of a vehicle who has filed an affidavit with the appropriate licensed operator in accordance with <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82235">Section 7-607</a> of this title shall be a separate and distinct color from all other decals issued under this section.</p>

<p>2. a. The operation of a street-legal utility vehicle on the streets and highways of this state requires the vehicle be issued a certificate of registration and license plate to be renewed annually. Upon the filing of a registration application and the payment of the fees provided for in the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, shall assign to the vehicle described in the application a distinctive number, and issue to the owner of the vehicle a certificate of registration, one license plate and a yearly decal. For each subsequent registration year, Service Oklahoma shall issue a yearly decal to be affixed to the license plate. The initial decal for a street-legal utility vehicle shall be attached to the front of the vehicle and shall be in clear view. The yearly decal shall have an identification number and the last two numbers of the registration year for which it shall expire. Except as provided by Section 1113A of this title, the license plate shall be affixed to the exterior of the vehicle until a replacement license plate is issued. If the owner applies for a replacement license plate, Service Oklahoma shall charge the fee provided for in Section 1114 of this title. The yearly decal will validate the license plate for each registration period other than the year the license plate is issued. The license plate and decal shall be of such size, color, design, and numbering as Service Oklahoma may direct. However, yearly decals issued to the owner of a vehicle who has filed an affidavit with the appropriate licensed operator in accordance with Section 7-607 of this title shall be a separate and distinct color from all other decals issued under this section.</p>

<p>b. Service Oklahoma shall design and issue a temporary tag to out-of-state owners of street-legal utility vehicles. The temporary tag shall be recognized in lieu of registration in this state. The temporary tag shall clearly indicate the date of issuance and the date of expiration, which shall be five (5) days, including the day of issuance. Upon application for a temporary tag, the out-of-state owner shall show proof of insurance coverage that satisfies the requirements of the Compulsory Insurance Law pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82223">Section 7-600</a> et seq. of this title. Service Oklahoma is authorized to promulgate rules and procedures to implement the provisions of this paragraph.</p>

<p>3. The license plate shall be securely attached to the rear of the vehicle, except truck-tractor plates which shall be attached to the front of the vehicle. Service Oklahoma may, with the concurrence of the Department of Public Safety, by Joint Rule, change and direct the manner, place, and location of display of any vehicle license plate when such action is deemed in the public interest. The license plate, decal and all letters and numbers shall be clearly visible at all times. The operation of a vehicle in this state, regardless of where such vehicle is registered, upon which the license plate is covered, overlaid, or otherwise screened with any material, whether such material be clear, translucent, tinted or opaque, shall be a violation of this paragraph.</p>

<p>4. Upon payment of the annual registration fee provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440198">Section 1133</a> of this title, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, or a licensed operator may issue a permanent nonexpiring license plate to an owner of one hundred or more commercial motor vehicles and for vehicles registered under the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440194">Section 1120</a> of this title. Upon payment of the annual registration fee, Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall issue a certificate of registration that shall be carried at all times in the vehicle for which it is issued. Provided, if the registrant submits its application through electronic means, such qualified owners of one hundred or more commercial motor vehicles, properly registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 1133 of this title, may elect to receive a permanent certificate of registration that shall be carried at all times in the vehicle for which it is issued.</p>

<p>5. Every vehicle owned by an agency of this state shall be exempt from the payment of registration fees required by this title. Provided, such vehicle shall be registered and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act.</p>

<p>B. The license plates required under the provisions of this title shall conform to the requirements and specifications listed hereinafter:</p>

<p>1. Each license plate shall have a space for the placement of the yearly decals for each succeeding year of registration after the initial issue;</p>

<p>2. The provisions of the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act regarding the issuance of yearly decals shall not apply to the issuance of apportioned license plates, including license plates for state vehicles, and exempt plates for governmental entities and fire departments organized pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=66962">Section 592 of Title 18</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes;</p>

<p>3. All license plates and decals shall be made with reflectorized material as a background to the letters, numbers and characters displayed thereon. The reflectorized material shall be of such a nature as to provide effective and dependable brightness during the service period for which the license plate or decal is issued;</p>

<p>4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for all state vehicles. Such license plates shall be permanent in nature and designed in such manner as to remain with the vehicle for the duration of the vehicles life span or until the title is transferred to a nongovernmental owner;</p>

<p>5. Within the limits prescribed in this section, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for vehicles of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The license plates shall have the legend Oklahoma OK and shall contain the letters OHP followed by the state seal and the badge number of the Highway Patrol officer to whom the vehicle is assigned. The words Oklahoma Highway Patrol shall also be included on such license plates;</p>

<p>6. Within the limits prescribed in this section, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for vehicles of the Military Department of the State of Oklahoma. Such license plates shall have the legend Oklahoma OK and shall contain the letters OMD followed by the state seal and three numbers or letters as designated by the Adjutant General. The words Oklahoma Military Department shall also be included on such license plates;</p>

<p>7. Within the limits prescribed in this section, Service Oklahoma shall design appropriate official license plates for vehicles of the Department of Corrections. Such license plates shall contain the letters DOC followed by the Department of Corrections badge and three numbers or letters or combination of both as designated by the Director of the agency. The words Department of Corrections shall also be included on such license plates; and</p>

<p>8. Within the limits prescribed in this section, the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department shall design any license plates required by the initiation of a license plate reissuance by Service Oklahoma at the request of the Department of Public Safety pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=453245">Section 1113.2</a> of this title. Any such new designs shall be submitted by the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department to the Department of Public Safety for its approval prior to being issued by Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>C. Where the applicant has satisfactorily shown that the applicant owns the vehicle sought to be registered but is unable to produce documentary evidence of the ownership, a license plate may be issued upon approval by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable. In such instances the reason for not issuing a certificate of title shall be indicated on the receipt given to the applicant. It shall still be the duty of the applicant to immediately take all necessary steps to obtain the Oklahoma certificate of title and it shall be unlawful for the applicant to sell the vehicle until the certificate has been obtained in the applicants name.</p>

<p>D. The certificate of registration provided for in this section shall be in convenient form, and the certificate of registration, or a certified copy or photostatic copy thereof, duly authenticated by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission, as applicable, shall be carried at all times in or upon all vehicles so registered, in such manner as to permit a ready examination thereof upon demand by any peace officer of the state or duly authorized employee of the Department of Public Safety. Any such officer or agent may seize and hold such vehicle when the operator of the same does not have the registration certificate in the operators possession or when any such officer or agent determines that the registration certificate has been obtained by misrepresentation of any essential or material fact or when any number or identifying information appearing on such certificate has been changed, altered, obliterated or concealed in any way, until the proper registration or identification of such vehicle has been made or produced by the owner thereof.</p>

<p>E. The purchaser of a new or used manufactured home shall, within thirty (30) days of the date of purchase, register the home with Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83058">Section 1117</a> of this title. For a new manufactured home, it shall be the responsibility of the dealer selling the home to place a temporary license plate on the home in the same manner as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83071">Section 1128 </a>of this title for other new motor vehicles. For the first year that any manufactured home is registered in this state, Service Oklahoma shall issue a metal license plate which shall be affixed to the manufactured home. The temporary dealer license plate or the metal license plate shall be displayed on the manufactured home at all times when upon a public roadway; provided, a repossession affidavit issued pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438859">Sections 1110</a> and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83069">1126</a> of this title shall be permissible in lieu of a current license plate and decal for the purposes of removing a repossessed manufactured home to a secure location. Manufactured homes previously registered and subject to ad valorem taxation as provided by law shall have a decal affixed at the time ad valorem taxes are paid for such manufactured home; provided, for a manufactured home permanently affixed to real estate, no decal or license plate shall be required to be affixed and the owner thereof shall be given a receipt upon payment of ad valorem taxes due on the home. Service Oklahoma shall make sufficient plates and decals available to the various licensed operators of the state in order for an owner of a manufactured home to acquire the plate or decal. A one-dollar fee shall be charged for issuance of any plate or decal. The fee shall be apportioned each month to the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury.</p>

<p>F. The decal shall be easily visible for purposes of verification by a county assessor that the manufactured home is properly assessed for ad valorem taxation. In the first year of registration, a decal shall be issued for placement on the license plate indicating payment of applicable registration fees and excise taxes. A duplicate manufactured home registration decal shall be affixed inside the window nearest the front door of the manufactured home. In the second and all subsequent years for which the manufactured home is subject to ad valorem taxation, an annual decal shall be affixed inside the window nearest the front door as evidence of payment of ad valorem taxes. Service Oklahoma shall issue decals to the various county treasurers of the state in order for a manufactured home owner to obtain such decal each year. Upon presentation of a valid ad valorem tax receipt, the manufactured home owner shall be issued the annual decal.</p>

<p>G. Upon the registration of a manufactured home in this state for the first time or upon discovery of a manufactured home previously registered within this state for which the information required by this subsection is not known, Service Oklahoma shall obtain:</p>

<p>1. The name of the owner of the manufactured home;</p>

<p>2. The serial number or identification number of the manufactured home;</p>

<p>3. A legal description or address of the location for the home;</p>

<p>4. The actual retail selling price of the manufactured home excluding Oklahoma taxes;</p>

<p>5. The certificate of title number for the home; and</p>

<p>6. Any other information which Service Oklahoma deems to be necessary.</p>

<p>The application for registration shall also include the school district in which the manufactured home is located or is to be located. The information shall be entered into a computer data system which shall be used by Service Oklahoma to provide information to county assessors upon request by the assessor. The assessor may request any information from the system in order to properly assess a manufactured home for ad valorem taxation.</p>
