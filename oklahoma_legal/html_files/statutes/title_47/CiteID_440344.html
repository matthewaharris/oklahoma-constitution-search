</div>
<p>A. Service Oklahoma is hereby authorized to design and issue appropriate official special license plates to persons in recognition of their service or awards as provided by this section.</p>

<p>Special license plates shall not be transferred to any other person but shall be removed from the vehicle upon transfer of ownership and retained. The special license plate may then be used on another vehicle but only after such other vehicle has been registered for the current year.</p>

<p>Special license plates shall be renewed each year by Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator. Service Oklahoma shall annually notify all persons issued special license plates. Service Oklahoma shall send the notifications to the electronic mail address provided by the person. If a person does not provide an electronic mail address, Service Oklahoma shall notify the person by mail. The notice shall contain all necessary information and shall contain instructions for the renewal procedure upon presentation to a licensed operator or Service Oklahoma. The license plates shall be issued on a staggered system except for legislative plates and amateur radio operator license plates.</p>

<p>On and after January 1, 2022, if a special license plate is issued pursuant to this section, any registration fee required for such plate pursuant to this section and the fee required pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438851">Section 1132</a> of this title shall be remitted at the same time and subject to a single registration period. Service Oklahoma shall determine, by rule, a method for making required fee and registration period adjustments if a special license plate is obtained during a twelve-month period for which a registration fee has already been remitted pursuant to Section 1132 of this title. The combination of fees in a single remittance shall not alter the apportionment otherwise provided for in this section.</p>

<p>Service Oklahoma is hereby directed to develop and implement a system whereby licensed operators are permitted to accept applications for special license plates authorized under this section. The licensed operator shall confirm the applicants eligibility, if applicable, collect and deposit any amount specifically authorized by law, accept and process the necessary information directly into such system and generate a receipt accordingly. For performance of these duties, licensed operators shall retain the fee provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83096">Section 1141.1</a> of this title for registration of a motor vehicle. The licensed operator fees for acceptance of applications and renewals shall be paid out of the Oklahoma Tax Commission Reimbursement Fund. Beginning January 1, 2023, the licensed operator fees for acceptance of applications and renewals shall be paid out of the Service Oklahoma Reimbursement Fund.</p>

The fee provided by this section for the special license plate authorized by this paragraph shall be in addition to all other registration fees provided by law, except the registration fees levied by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438851">Section 1132</a> of this title;</p>
