Appointments made after July 1 of the year in which such modification becomes effective shall be from any redrawn districts which are not represented by a board member until such time as each of the modified congressional districts are represented by a board member; provided, the chair shall be appointed at large without regard to congressional district representation on the board;</p>

<p>2. All members shall be appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;</p>

One of the at-large members shall be engaged in the principal business of selling manufactured homes as a licensed manufactured home dealer. Being engaged in one or more of such pursuits shall not disqualify a person otherwise qualified from serving on the Commission.</p>

<p>2. The terms of office of each member of the Commission shall be subject to the following:</p>

<p>b. each member actively serving July 1, 2000, who was appointed on or before June 30, 2000, shall remain and fulfill the term of his or her membership as set forth at the appointment,</p>

<p>c. except for the chair, the term of office of each member of the Commission shall be for six (6) years,</p>

<p>d. except for the chair and the at-large members, the term of office of any member will automatically expire if the member moves out of the congressional district from which appointed; however, if the congressional districts are modified each member shall complete the current term of office as provided in this section,</p>

<p>e. in event of death, resignation, or removal of any person serving on the Commission, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment as aforesaid for the unexpired portion of the term, and</p>

<p>f. except for the chair, when the term of a member automatically expires, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment of a qualified successor for a term of six (6) years as aforesaid, except that the member shall serve until a successor is appointed and qualified.</p>

<p>3. The chair and each member of the Commission shall take and subscribe to the oath of office required of public officers.</p>

<p>C. The chair and members of the Commission shall receive Thirty Dollars ($30.00) for each and every day actually and necessarily spent in attending the meetings of the Commission, and shall be reimbursed for subsistence and traveling expenses incurred in the performance of their duties hereunder as provided by the State Travel Reimbursement Act; provided that such meeting payments shall not exceed the sum of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) per annum to any one person.</p>
