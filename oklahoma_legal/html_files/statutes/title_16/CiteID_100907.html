<P>Title Examination Standards<BR>Chapter 1, App.<BR>Chapter 25.&nbsp;Tax 
Liens<BR>§25.1. The General Federal Tax Lien.</P>
<P><STRONG>CAVEAT</STRONG></P>
<P><EM>1. The material in this chapter is subject to comparatively rapid change. 
Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the date of adoption as 
reflected in the history of each standard.</EM></P>
<P><EM>2. Securities and motor vehicles as defined by 26 U.S.C.A. § 6323(h)(3) 
&amp; (4) are not within the purview of Chapter 25.</EM></P>
<P><EM>3. In addition, Chapter 25 does not deal with the Federal priority 
statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3713(a).</EM></P>
<P>Note: Although the special estate and gift tax liens are treated in Standards 
25.2, 25.3 and 25.4, respectively, it is important to remember that such special 
tax liens are separate liens and are in addition to the general tax lien.</P>
<P>A. SCOPE.</P>
<P>Any federal tax, with any applicable interest, penalties and costs, without 
notice and from the time of assessment, is a lien in favor of the United States 
upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to 
the person liable to pay the tax. Although the lien is effective as of the time 
of assessment, an enforceable general federal tax lien arises only when the 
following three events have occurred: (1) a tax assessment is made; (2) the 
taxpayer is given proper notice of the assessment and demand for payment; and 
(3) the taxpayer fails to pay the assessed taxes within ten (10) days after 
notice of assessment and demand for payment. The lien is not valid as to any 
purchaser, holder of a security interest, (under federal law, "security 
interest" means a lien on real or personal property), mechanic's lienor or 
judgment lien creditor until notice thereof has been filed for record in the 
office of the county clerk in which the land is located.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>Authority: 26 U.S.C.A. §§ 6321, 6322 &amp; 6323.</P>
<P>Comment: </P>
<P>1. Property subject to the general federal tax lien includes, but is not 
limited to, the taxpayer's interest in:</P>
<P>a. After-acquired property, 42 O.S. § 8; <EM>Glass City Bank of Jeanette, Pa. 
v. United</EM> <EM>States</EM> , 326 U.S. 265, 66 S.Ct. 108, 90 L.Ed. 56 
(1945).</P>
<P>b. Property held in joint tenancy, 60 O.S. 1961 § 74; <EM>United States 
v.</EM> <EM>Brandenburg</EM> , 106 F.Supp. 82 (S.D. Cal. 1952).</P>
<P>c. Homestead property, <EM>Tillery v. Parks</EM>, 630 F.2d 775 (10th Cir. 
1980) (federal tax liens arising solely through the tax liability of a tax 
debtor may attach to the tax debtor's interest in the homestead property owned 
by the tax debtor) and <EM>United</EM> <EM>States v. Rodgers</EM> , 461 U.S. 
677, 103 S.Ct. 2132, 76 L.Ed. 236 (1983).</P>
<P>2.&nbsp;Title 26 U.S.C.A. § 6323(b)(6) provides, in part, that even if notice 
of lien has been filed, the general federal tax lien will not be valid against 
<U>the holder of</U> (1)&nbsp;local liens for real property taxes, special 
assessments and charges for services provided by a government owned public 
utility, which, under local law, are entitled to priority over security 
interests which are prior in time to such local liens, assessments and charges, 
(2) mechanic's lien for repairs on a personal residence but only to a maximum 
amount of $5,000 and only in a building containing not more than four dwelling 
units and (3) attorney's liens to the extent an attorney holds a lien or 
contract enforceable against a judgment or other amount. Title 26 U.S.C.A. § 
6323(c) provides, in part, a temporary priority for certain types of commercial 
financing for 45 days after a tax lien is filed. The relative priority of 
general federal tax liens against commercial transaction and financing 
agreements (including real property,construction financing) is fixed by 26 
U.S.C.A. § 6323(d).</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>3. The general federal tax lien does not have priority over a purchase money 
mortgage, <EM>United</EM> <EM>States v. New Orleans R.R</EM>., 79 U.S. (12 
Wall.) 362, 20 L.Ed. 434 (1870); <EM>Slodov v. United</EM> <EM>States</EM>, 436 
U.S. 238 (1978); <EM>Troyer v. Mundy</EM>, 60 F.2d 818 (8th Cir. 1932).</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>4. The general federal tax lien is not&nbsp;valid against any purchaser, 
holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor or judgment lien creditor until 
notice thereof has been properly filed.</P>
<P>a. From 1913 to 1925, federal tax lien notices in Oklahoma were required to 
be filed in the office of the United States District Court for the judicial 
district in which the land was located, Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1016, now 
26 U.S.C.A. § 6323(f)(1)(A)(1).</P>
<P>b. Subsequent to February 14, 1925, notices in Oklahoma have been and are 
required to be filed in the office of the county clerk of the county in which 
the land is located, 26 U.S.C.A. § 6323(f)(1)(A)(i).</P>
<P>c. It is not necessary that the notice contain a description of the land 
thereby affected, Treas. Reg. § 301.6323(f)-1(c); <EM>United States v. Union 
Central Life Insurance Co</EM> ., 368 U.S. 291, 82 S.Ct. 349, 7 L.Ed. 2d 294 
(1961). Note that 19 O.S. § 298 refers to conveyances, etc., but does not 
pertain to federal tax liens.</P>
<P>d. Actual knowledge of the assessment of the general federal tax lien does 
not deprive a purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lien or 
judgment lien creditor of priority until the notice of the lien is filed, 
<EM>United States v. Beaver Run Coal Co</EM> ., 99 F.2d 610 (3d Cir. 1938). Some 
courts, though, intimate that actual knowledge may take the place of filing of 
notice. See annotation at 2 L.Ed. 2d 1845. However, actual knowledge affects the 
priorities as to securities, motor vehicles, personal property purchased in 
casual sales, insurance policy loans, passbook loans and commercial transaction 
financing under the provisions of 26 U.S.C.A.&nbsp;§§ 6323(b)(1), (2), (4), (9), 
(10) and 6323(c)(1).</P>
<P>5. A trustee in bankruptcy is a "judgment creditor" under the terms of 26 
U.S.C.A. § 6323, <EM>United States v. Speers</EM> , 382 U.S. 266, 86 S.Ct. 411, 
15 L.Ed. 2d 314 (1965).</P>
<P>6. Note <EM>United States v. McDermott</EM> , 507 U.S. 448, 113 S.Ct. 1526, 
123 L.Ed. 2d 128 (1993), in which a federal tax lien was held to have priority 
over a previously filed judgment lien with respect to taxpayer's real property 
acquired after the filing of both liens.</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>B. DURATION.</P>
<P>The general federal tax lien continues until it is satisfied or becomes 
unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.</P>
<P>The limitation period for such liens is generally as follows:</P>
<DIR>
<P>1. Liens Assessed Prior to November 5, 1990.</P>
<DIR>
<P>a. The limitation period for liens assessed prior to November 5, 1990 is six 
years and thirty days from the date of assessment. As to those liens for which 
the limitation period of six years and thirty days from date of assessment had 
run as of November 5, 1990, and for which the lien period had not been extended, 
suspended or renewed, the lien shall be deemed to have expired.</P>
<P>b. As to those liens for which the limitation period of six years and thirty 
days from date of assessment had not run as of November 5, 1990, the lien period 
shall be ten years and thirty days from date of the original tax 
assessment.</P></DIR>
<P>2. Liens Assessed On or After November 5, 1990.</P></DIR>
<P>As to those liens filed on or after November 5, 1990, the lien period shall 
be ten years and 30 days from the date of assessment.</P>
<P>Authority: 26 U.S.C.A. §§ 6322, 6502 &amp; 6503.</P>
<DIR>
<P>Caveat: The elapse of the applicable statutory period for the general federal 
tax lien does not, in itself, constitute conclusive evidence that the lien has 
expired. The examiner should be aware of the various methods, set out in the 
statute, by which the applicable limitation period may be extended or suspended, 
and the general federal tax lien may be renewed. Examples of some of these 
methods are set out below.</P>
<P>Comment: The effective period of a lien may be extended, and the running of 
such period may be suspended. For example, the effective period may have been 
extended or suspended: (1) by written agreement with the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C.A. § 
6502(a); (2) by waiver of the statute of limitation by the taxpayer pending 
acceptance or rejection by the government of a compromise offer; (3) for the 
period during which assessment or use of creditors' process was prohibited (and 
while a related proceeding is on the docket of the Tax Court) and for sixty (60) 
days thereafter, 26 U.S.C.A. § 6503(a)(1); (4) for the period during which 
assets of the taxpayer were in the control or custody of any court and for six 
(6) months thereafter, 26 U.S.C.A. § 6503(b); (5) for the period during which 
collection is hindered or delayed by the fact that the taxpayer is outside of 
the United States, if such absence is continuous for a period of at least six 
months (such period not to expire until six (6) months after the date of return 
to the United States), 26 U.S.C. § 6503(c); (6) for the period, not in excess of 
two years, from the date of instituting bankruptcy or receivership proceedings 
to thirty (30) days after the notice from the receiver or other fiduciary is 
given, 26 U.S.C. § 6872; (7) for the period equal to the period from the date 
property of a third party is wrongfully seized or received by the Secretary to 
the date the Secretary returns the property or the date on which a judgment 
secured pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7426 with respect to such property becomes 
final, and for thirty (30) days thereafter, 26 U.S.C.A. § 6503(f); (8) as to 
estate taxes, for the period of any extension of time for payment granted under 
the provisions of 26 U.S.C. § 6161(a)(2) or (b)(2) or under the provisions of 26 
U.S.C. §§ 6163 or 6166, see 26 U.S.C. § 6503(d); or (9) as to Title 11 cases, 
for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited by reason of such case 
from making the assessment and for sixty (60) days thereafter, 26 U.S.C. § 
6503(h).</P>
<P>Various statutory provisions also suspend the running of time on account of 
military service, 50 U.S.C. App. § 573 (Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief 
Act); 26 U.S.C. § 7508. The period during which a tax may be collected by levy 
is not extended or curtailed by reason of a judgment against the taxpayer, 26 
U.S.C. § 6502(a).</P>
<P>A general federal tax lien may be renewed by refiling the Notice of Federal 
Tax Lien. In order to maintain the enforceability of the lien from date of 
assessment through the renewal period, a notice of lien must be refiled within 
the one-year period ending thirty days after the expiration of the applicable 
six or ten year period discussed above. If the Notice of Federal Tax Lien is not 
refiled during this period, the lien shall be deemed to have expired at the end 
of the applicable limitation period. Provisions exist in the statute for a 
second and subsequent renewal of the lien period by a second refiling of the 
notice of lien within the time periods set out in the statute. 26 U.S.C.A. § 
6323 (g).</P>
<P>Caveat: A notice of lien may be refiled after the last refile date stated on 
the face of the notice of lien, in instances in which the limitation period on 
collection after assessment has not expired. In such instances, the notice of 
lien refiled after the last stated refiling date shall be effective from the 
date of such refiling. 26 U.S.C. § 6325(f)(2).</P></DIR>
<P>C. RELEASE AND DISCHARGE.</P>
<P>A certificate of release, discharge, subordination or non-attachment of any 
internal revenue lien generally may be relied upon by a bona fide purchaser, 
holder of a security interest, mechanic's lien or judgment lien creditor for 
value, as conclusive that the entire lien has been released or that the lands 
described in the certificate have been discharged from the tax lien.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>Authority: 26 U.S.C. § 6325(f).</P>
<P>Comment: 1. The issuance of such a certificate is not conclusive in all cases 
that the lien is extinguished. The certificate may be revoked for reasons cited 
in 26 U.S.C. § 6325(f)(2). It is not conclusive that the tax liability has been 
paid and, in the hands of the taxpayer, such property may still be subject to a 
lien upon notice and refiling, 26 U.S.C. § 6325(f)(3). Reliance by the taxpayer 
upon such certificate is a mistake of law by which the government may not be 
estopped, <EM>Miller v. Commissioner</EM>, 23 T.C. 565 (1954), <EM>aff'd</EM>., 
231 F.2d 8 (5th Cir. 1956). In the hands of a transferee as defined in 26 U.S.C. 
§ 6901, the property may still be subject to tax liability, <EM>Commissioner v. 
Angier Corp</EM>., 50 F.2d 887 (Ist Cir. 1931), <EM>cert. denied</EM> , 284 U.S. 
673, 52 S.Ct. 129, 76 L.Ed. 569 (1931).</P>
<P>2. A certificate of release of a lien may be issued if either of the 
conditions set forth in 26 U.S.C. § 6325(a)(1) or (2) is met.</P>
<P>3. A certificate of discharge of property may be issued if any one of the 
conditions set forth in 26 U.S.C.A. § 6325(b)(1), (2) or (3) is met.</P>
<P>4. A certificate of subordination may be issued if the conditions set forth 
in 26 U.S.C. § 6325(d)(1), (2) or (3) is met.</P>
<P>5. A certificate of non-attachment may be issued where, because of a 
confusion of names or otherwise, a notice of lien has been filed, and the lien 
is clouding title to property belonging to a person other than the taxpayer, 26 
U.S.C. § 6325(e).</P></DIR></DIR><B><I>

<P>History: This standard was reworked completely and its adoption recommended 
by the Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee, 57 O.B.J. 2677, 
2682-85 (1986). It was approved by the Real Property Section, November 20, 1986, 
and adopted by the House of Delegates, November 21, 1986. The 1994 Report of the 
Title Examination Standards Committee recommended amending Section B of the 
standard to reflect 1990 amendments to the Internal Revenue Code and adding 
Comment 6 to Section A. 65 O.B.A.J. 3334 (10/22/94). The Committee's 
recommendation was approved by the Real Property Section on November 17, 1994,
