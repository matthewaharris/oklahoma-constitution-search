<P>History: This standard was developed as a result of 
<EM>Cate v. Archon, supra</EM>            . It was contained in the 1986 Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee, 57 O.B.J. 2677, 2681-82 (1986). After that publication, the Committee received several suggestions from members of the Real Property Section. The Executive Committee of the Section amended the recommendation substantially before submission to the Section. As amended, the recommendation was approved by the Section, November 20, 1986, and adopted by the House of Delegates, November 21, 1986.</P>
<P>The 1987 Title Examination Standards Committee, in its report, 58 O.B.J. 2839, 2843 (1987) recommended several changes in the standard which were approved by the Real Property Section, November 12, 1987, and adopted by the House of Delegates, November 13, 1987. The effective dates in pre-existing material were expressed in different words. For example "After March 22, 1985" became "On or after March 23, 1985". Parts "A.3." and "B.2." were added to conform the standard Aith amendments to 12 O.S. §§ 764, 765 and 2004.2. The "Caveat" was moved from the former end of part "A." to the new end thereof.</P>
<P>The 1991 Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee, 62 O.B.A.J. 3269 (1991), proposed the addition of 12.4, A, 3, a, iv, to correspond to the statutory language and recent case law, and comment number 3 following paragraph A to point out recent case law on the rights of disclaiming parties. The changes were approved by the Real Property Section on November 14, 1991 and adopted by the House of Delegates November 15, 1992, 62 O.B.A.J. 3531 (1991).</P>
