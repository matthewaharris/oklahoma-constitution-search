<P>History: The 1985 Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee proposed this Standard, 56 O.B.J. 2535, 2538-39 (1985). The proposal was amended by the Real Property Section, November 14, 1985, by adding the words "or upon a certified copy thereof' in (A)(b), (B)(b) and (C)(b) of the standard and deleting all of part (D). As amended, it was adopted by the House of Delegates on November 15, 1985, 57 O.B.J. 5-6 (1986).</P>
<P>The report of the 1987 Title Examination Standards Committee recommended the "Note" appearing immediately after the title of the standard and that parenthetical material be added to parts (A)(d) and (A)(c) of the standard. The Real Property Section approved the recommendations, November 12, 1987, and the House of Delegates adopted them, November 13, 1987.</P>
<P>The 1988 Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee, 59 O.B.J. 3098, 3104-06 (1988) proposed amendments to this standard which will be found in (A)(e) in which the previous parenthetical clause has been deleted; in the following "Authority" to which 16 O.S. § 27a has been added; in (C)(f) which has been added; and in the following "Authority" to which 16 O.S. § 27a has been added. These changes reflect the amendments to § 27a referring to governmental planning authorities.</P>
<P>The 1992 Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee, 63 O.B.J. 2903, 2906-07 (10/17/92), recommended adding clauses at the ends of paragraphs (B)(2) and (C)(e) of this standard to respond to the amendment of 19 O.S. § 863.10 by 1992 Okla. Sess. Law, ch. 47 § 2. The Committee's proposal was approved by the Real Property Law Section, November 12, 1992, and adopted by the House of Delegates, November 13,1992.</P>
<P>In 1996, the Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee proposed amending the standard to deal with "remainder tracts ." 67 O.B.J. 3247, 3252 (1996). The Real Property Section approved the proposal on November 14, 1996; the House of Delegates adopted the amendment on November 15,1996.</P>
<P>The 2006 Report of the Title Examination Standards Committee recommended amending Standard 35.3 to reflect the change in the law as reflected by the amendment of 19 O.S. § 863.10 which became effective on November 1, 2006. The Real Property Law Section approved, November 16, 2006, and the House of Delegates adopted the proposal November 17, 2006.</P>
<P>The 2012 Report of the Title of the Title Examination Standards Committee recommended amending Standard 35.3 to clarify the plan referred to in the standard is a joint city-county plan as is provided for in the governing statutes. The Committee's proposal was approved by the Real Property Law Section on November 15, 2012 and approved by the House of Delegates on November 16, 2012.</P>
<P>The 2014 Report of the Title of the Title Examination Standards Committee recommended an amendment to this Standard to conform the Standard to the governing statute. The Real Property Section approved the proposal on November 13, 2014, and the House of Delegates adopted the amendment on November 14, 2014.

<P>The 2018 Title Examination Standards Sub-Committee recommended a caveat be added to Standard 35.3 B to make examiners aware of a provision in the new subdivision standards for the City and County of Tulsa regarding the divisions of land involving tracts of five acres or greater. </FONT></FONT>The Real Property Law Section approved the proposal on November 8, 2018 and the House of Delegates adopted the proposal on November 9, 2018, effective immediately.
