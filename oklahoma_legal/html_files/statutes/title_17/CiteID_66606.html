<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. To ensure an orderly and equitable 
restructuring of the electric utility industry in this state and achieve the 
goals outlined in Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=66604"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>190.2</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this title, the 
Legislature hereby directs the Joint Electric Utility Task Force to undertake a 
study of all relevant issues relating to restructuring the electric utility 
industry in this state including, but not limited to, those issues set forth in 
this section, and develop a proposed electric utility industry restructuring 
framework for the State of Oklahoma. The Joint Electric Utility Task Force shall 
address appropriate steps to achieve an orderly transition to a competitive 
market and may include in addition to the directives in this act 1 other 
provisions as the task force shall deem necessary and appropriate to expedite 
the transition to full consumer choice. The Corporation Commission shall assist 
the task force in achieving the goals outlined in the Electric Restructuring Act 
of 1997; 1 provided, however, during the transition period to full consumer 
choice, the Corporation Commission is expressly prohibited from promulgating any 
rules or issuing any orders relating to the restructuring of Oklahoma's electric 
utility industry without prior express authorization by the Oklahoma State 
Legislature.</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. It is the intent of the Legislature 
that the following principles and directives be adhered to in developing a 
framework for a restructured industry: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Reliability and safety. Appropriate rules shall be 
promulgated, in accordance with the provisions of this act, ensuring that 
reliable and safe electric service is maintained; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Competition. Competitive markets are to be 
encouraged to the greatest extent possible. Regulation should serve as a 
substitute only in those circumstances where competition cannot provide results 
that serve the best interests of all consumers; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Consumer choice. Consumers shall be allowed to 
choose among retail electric energy suppliers to help ensure fully competitive 
and innovative markets. A process should be established whereby all retail 
consumers are permitted to choose their retail electric energy suppliers by July 
1, 2002. Consumer choice means that retail electric consumers shall be allowed 
to purchase different levels and quality of electric supply from a variety of 
retail electric energy suppliers and that every seller of electric generation in 
the retail market shall have nondiscriminatory open access to the electric 
distribution system of every retail electric service distributor, subject to 
this act. The Corporation Commission should ensure that consumer confusion will 
be minimized and consumers will be well informed about changes resulting from 
restructuring and increased choice; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Regulation and unbundling of services. Entities 
which own both transmission and distribution, as well as generation facilities, 
shall not be allowed to use any monopoly position in these services as a barrier 
to competition. Generation services may be subject to minimal regulation and 
shall be functionally separated from transmission and distribution services, 
which services shall remain regulated. All retail electric energy suppliers 
shall be required to meet certain minimum standards designed to ensure 
reliability and financial integrity, and be registered with the Corporation 
Commission; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Unbundling of rates. When consumer choice is 
introduced, rates shall be unbundled to provide clear price information on the 
components of generation, transmission and distribution and any other ancillary 
charges. Electric bills for all classes shall be unbundled, utilizing line 
itemization to reveal the various component cost of providing electrical 
services. Charges for public benefit programs currently authorized by statute or 
the Commission, or both, shall be unbundled and appear in line item format on 
electric bills for all classes of consumers; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Open access to transmission and distribution 
facilities. Consumer access to alternative suppliers of electricity requires 
open access to the transmission grid and the distribution system. Comparability 
shall be assured for retail electric energy suppliers competing with affiliates 
of entities supplying transmission and distribution services. The Corporation 
Commission shall monitor companies providing transmission and distribution 
services and take necessary measures to ensure that no supplier of such services 
has an unfair advantage in offering and pricing such services; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Obligation to connect and establishment of firm 
service territories. An entity providing distribution services shall be relieved 
of its traditional obligation to provide electric supply but shall have a 
continuing obligation to provide distribution service for all consumers in its 
service territory. As part of the restructuring process firm service territories 
shall be fixed by a date certain, if not currently established by law in order 
to avoid wasteful duplication of distribution facilities; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Independent system planning committee. The 
benefits associated with implementing an independent system planning committee 
composed of owners of electric distribution systems to develop and maintain 
planning and reliability criteria for distribution facilities shall be 
evaluated; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. Consumer safeguards. Minimum residential consumer 
service safeguards and protections shall be ensured including programs and 
mechanisms that enable residential consumers with limited incomes to obtain 
affordable essential electric service, and the establishment of a default 
provider or providers for any distribution customer who has not chosen an 
alternative retail electric energy supplier; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. Establishment of a transition period. A defined 
period for the transition to a restructured electric utility industry shall be 
established. The transition period shall reflect a suitable time frame for full 
compliance with the requirements of a restructured utility industry; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. Rates for service. Electric rates for all 
consumer classes shall not rise above current levels throughout the transition 
period. If possible, electric rates for all consumers shall be lowered when 
feasible as markets become more efficient in a restructured industry; 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. Establishment of a distribution access fee. The 
task force shall consider the establishment of a distribution access fee to be 
assessed to all consumers in the State of Oklahoma connected to electric 
distribution systems regulated by the Corporation Commission. This fee shall be 
charged to cover social costs, capital costs, operating costs, and other 
appropriate costs associated with the operation of electric distribution systems 
and the provision of electric service to the retail consumer; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>13. Recovery of stranded costs. Electric utilities 
have traditionally had an obligation to provide service to consumers within 
their established service territories and have entered into contracts, long-term 
investments and federally mandated co-generation contracts to meet the needs of 
consumers. These investments and contracts have resulted in costs which may not 
be recoverable in a competitive restructured market and thus may be "stranded". 
Procedures shall be established for identifying and quantifying stranded 
investments and for allocating costs and mechanisms shall be proposed for 
recovery of an appropriate amount of prudently incurred, immitigable and 
verifiable stranded costs and investments. As part of this process, each entity 
shall be required to propose a recovery plan which establishes its unimitigable 
and verifiable stranded costs and investments and a limited recovery period 
designed to recover such costs expeditiously, provided that the recovery period 
and the amount of qualified transition costs shall yield a transition charge 
which shall not cause the total price for electric power, including transmission 
and distribution services, for any consumer to exceed the cost per kilowatt-hour 
paid on April 25, 1997, during the transition period. The transition charge 
shall be applied to all consumers including direct access consumers, and shall 
not disadvantage one class of consumer or supplier over another, nor impede 
competition and shall be allocated over a period of not less than three (3) 
years nor more than seven (7) years; and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>14. Transition costs. All transition costs shall be 
recovered by virtue of the savings generated by the increased efficiency in 
markets brought about by restructuring of the electric utility industry. All 
classes of consumers shall share in the transition costs. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The study of all relevant issues 
related to electric industry restructuring shall be divided into four parts, as 
follows: independent system operator issues, technical issues, financial issues 
and consumer issues. All studies created pursuant to this section shall be 
conducted under the direction of the Joint Electric Utility Task Force. The task 
force shall direct the Corporation Commission, the Oklahoma Tax Commission, any 
other state agency or consultant as necessary to assist the task force in the 
completion of such studies. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The Commission shall commence the study of 
independent system operator issues no later than July 1, 1997, and provide a 
final report to the Joint Electric Utility Task Force no later than February 1, 
1998. Such report shall be in writing and shall make recommendations as the 
Commission deems necessary and appropriate regarding the establishment of an 
independent system operator in the State of Oklahoma or the appropriate region. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. No later than July 1, 1998, the Joint Electric 
Utility Task Force shall commence the study of technical issues related to the 
restructuring of the electric utility industry. Such study shall include, but is 
not limited to, the examination of: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. reliability and safety, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. unbundling of generation, transmission and 
distribution services, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. market power, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. open access to transmission and distribution, 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. transition issues, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. any other technical issues the task force deems 
appropriate. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>A final report shall be completed by 
the Joint Electric Utility Task Force no later than October 1, 1999. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. No later than July 1, 1998, the Joint Electric 
Utility Task Force shall commence the study of financial issues related to 
restructuring of the electric utility industry. Such study shall include, but is 
not limited to, the examination of: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. rates and charges, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. access and transition costs and fees, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. stranded costs and their recovery, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. stranded benefits and their funding, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. municipal financing, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. cooperative financing, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>g. investor-owned utility financing, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>h. any other financial issues the task force deems 
appropriate. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>A final report shall be completed by 
the Joint Electric Utility Task Force no later than October 1, 1999. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. No later than September 1, 1998, the Joint 
Electric Utility Task Force shall commence the study of consumer issues related 
to restructuring of the electric utility industry. Such study shall include, but 
is not limited to, the examination of: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. service territories, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the obligation to serve, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. the obligation to connect, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. consumer safeguards, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. rates for regulated services, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. consumer choices, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>g. competition, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>h. licensing of retail electric energy suppliers, and 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>i. any other consumer issues the task force finds 
appropriate. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>A final report shall be completed by 
the Joint Electric Utility Task Force no later than October 1, 1999. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The Joint Electric Utility Task 
Force may, if it deems necessary, by a majority vote of the members combine or 
modify any of the studies required by this act. Provided, however, the task 
force shall not eliminate any of the issues required to be studied herein.
