<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The Corporation Commission shall have general 
supervision over all associations or cooperative corporations as defined herein 
with power to fix and establish rates and to prescribe rules affecting their 
services, operation, and the management and conduct of their business. It shall 
have full visitorial and inquisitorial power to examine such associations or 
cooperative corporations and keep informed as to their general conditions, their 
capitalization, rates, plants, equipments, apparatus, and other property owned, 
leased, controlled or operated, the value of same, the management, conduct, 
operation, practices and services; not only with respect to the adequacy, 
security and accommodation afforded by their service, but also with respect to 
their compliance with the provisions of the Retail Electric Supplier Certified 
Territory Act, and with the Constitution and laws of this state, and with the 
orders of the Commission. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable 
to generation and transmission associations or cooperative corporations, or 
transmission associations or cooperative corporations. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. 1. An association or cooperative corporation shall 
be subject to rate investigations by the Commission pursuant to subsection A of 
this section unless a proposed increase in rates and charges does not exceed 
three percent (3%) based on the previous twelve (12) months revenue generated by 
the existing rates; provided however, that such association or cooperative 
corporation shall be subject to subsection A of this section if: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the association or cooperative corporation elects, 
by action of its board of trustees, to be subject to rate investigation by the 
Commission, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the percentage of members, that according to 
bylaws constitute a quorum not to exceed five percent (5%) of the membership for 
that particular association or cooperative have signed a petition requesting 
rate investigation pursuant to paragraphs 3 or 4 of this subsection, or 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. the Commission declares that the association or 
cooperative corporation shall be subject to rate investigations by the 
Commission pursuant to paragraph 6 of this subsection. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Each such association or cooperative corporation 
not subject to rate investigation, at least ninety (90) days before the 
effective date of any proposed rate increase, shall notify the Commission and 
each of its member-consumers of the proposed rate increase. Notice to the 
Commission shall include a verified statement showing the then total number of 
member-consumers of the association or cooperative corporation. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Notice by the association or cooperative corporation 
to its member-consumers shall: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. be in a form prescribed by this section, 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. be by regular mail and may be included in regular 
member-consumer billings, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. include a schedule of the proposed rate schedules, 
the effective date of the proposed rate increase and the procedure necessary for 
the member-consumers to petition the Commission to examine and determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed rate increase. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The member-consumers of an association or a 
cooperative corporation may petition the Commission to examine and determine the 
reasonableness of the rates and charges proposed by the association or 
cooperative corporation pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph 1 of this 
subsection. The form of such a petition shall be substantially in compliance 
with subsection C of this section. A petition substantially in compliance with 
such form shall not be deemed invalid due to minor errors in its form. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If, by the effective date of this proposed 
increase in rates and charges, the Commission has received petitions from less 
than the number of member-consumers as set out in subparagraph b of paragraph 1 
of this subsection, requesting that the Commission examine the proposed increase 
in rates and charges, the Commission shall immediately certify such fact to the 
association or cooperative corporation. If, on or before the effective date of 
the proposed increase in rates and charges, the Commission has received 
petitions from the number of member-consumers as set out in subparagraph b of 
paragraph 1 of this subsection or more, the Commission shall notify the 
association or cooperative corporation that it will examine and determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed increase in rates and charges. Rates and charges 
established by the Commission or by an association or a cooperative corporation 
pursuant to this section shall be in force for not less than one (1) year and no 
further increases in rates and charges shall be permitted during said one-year 
period. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. No cooperative corporation or association shall 
have the right to receive more than one rate increase per year for any reason or 
under any procedures. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. In addition to the procedure for petition prior to 
any proposed increase in rates and charges pursuant to paragraphs 1 through 4 of 
this subsection, the member-consumers of an association or cooperative 
corporation may at any time petition the Commission to declare the association 
or cooperative corporation be subject to full scale rate investigation. If the 
Commission determines that a majority of the member-consumers of an association 
or a cooperative corporation have properly petitioned that the association or 
cooperative corporation be subject to full scale rate regulations, the 
Commission shall certify such fact to the association or cooperative corporation 
and thereafter the association or cooperative corporation shall be subject to 
full scale rate investigation by the Commission until at least a majority of the 
member-consumers of the association or cooperative corporation properly petition 
that the association or cooperative corporation shall no longer be subject to 
such full scale rate investigations by the Commission. The form of such a 
petition shall substantially comply with subsection C of this section. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A petition substantially in compliance with the form 
pursuant to subsection C of this section shall not be deemed invalid due to 
minor errors in its form. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Paragraphs 1 through 6 of this subsection apply 
only to the rates and charges and shall have no effect on the Commission's 
jurisdiction over the associations or cooperative corporations or the rules and 
regulations governing the operations of electric utilities. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Each association or cooperative corporation, when 
determining how rates and charges, established under paragraph 2 of this 
subsection, are to be allocated to the different rate classes, shall apportion 
such rates and charges in a manner which reflects, as closely as practicable, 
the costs of providing service to that class. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. In no event, and under no circumstances, shall the 
procedures herein provided be utilized for the purpose of establishing special 
competitive rates in any area in which a cooperative corporation is in direct 
competition with another regulated retail electric supplier. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. 1. A petition requesting the Commission to examine 
and determine the reasonableness of a proposed increase in rates and charges 
shall be in substantially the following form: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. Form: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The petition shall be headed by a caption, which 
shall contain (1) the heading, "Before the Corporation Commission of the State 
of Oklahoma"; (2) the name of the association or cooperative corporation seeking 
an increase in rates and charges; (3) the relief sought. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. Body: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The body of the petition shall consist of four 
numbered paragraphs, if applicable, as follows: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) Allegations of Facts: The allegations of facts 
stated in the form of ultimate facts, without unnecessary detail, upon which the 
right to relief is based. The allegations will be stated in numbered 
subparagraphs as necessary for clarity, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) Legal Authority: Retail Electric Supplier 
Certified Territory Act, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) Relief Sought: A brief statement of the amount of 
the increase in rates and charges that is objected to or other relief sought, 
and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) Petitioners: The name, address, telephone number 
and signature of each member-consumer. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A petition requesting rate regulation of an 
association or cooperative corporation shall be in substantially the following 
form: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. Form: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The petition shall be headed by a caption, which 
shall contain (1) the heading, "Before the Corporation Commission of the State 
of Oklahoma"; (2) the name of the association or cooperative corporation seeking 
an increase in rates and charges; (3) the relief sought. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. Body: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The body of the petition shall consist of four 
numbered paragraphs, if applicable, as follows: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) Allegations of Facts: The allegations of facts 
stated in the form of ultimate facts, without unnecessary detail, upon which the 
right to relief is based. The allegations will be stated in numbered 
subparagraphs as necessary for clarity, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) Legal Authority: Retail Electric Supplier 
Certified Territory Act, Sections </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=66535"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>158.21</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> through </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=66547"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>158.32</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> of Title 17 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) Relief Sought: A brief statement of the reason 
the petitioners seek the Commission to regulate the rates and charges of the 
association or cooperative corporation or other relief sought, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) Petitioners: The name, address, telephone number 
and signature of each member-consumer. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Petitions may only be signed by the 
member-consumer of the association or cooperative corporation. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Upon proceedings brought by an interested person 
or by action of the Commission, the Commission shall have the jurisdiction to 
enforce compliance with the Retail Electric Supplier Certified Territory Act, 
and shall have jurisdiction to prohibit furnishing retail electric service by 
any retail electric supplier except in its certified territory or territories, 
or where lawfully serving, and in connection with such enforcement and 
prohibition to exercise all powers herein or otherwise granted to the 
Commission. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. 1. Rural electric cooperatives, which are owned by 
the member-consumers they serve, are regulated by the member-consumers 
themselves acting through an elected governing board. It is declared that the 
regulation by the Commission under this section may be duplicative of the 
self-regulation by the rural electric cooperative and may be neither necessary 
nor cost-effective. It is therefore the purpose of this subsection to determine 
the necessity of regulation by the Commission by allowing the member-consumers 
of a rural electric cooperative to exempt themselves from regulation by the 
Commission except as provided herein. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 4, 5, 6 
and 7 of this subsection, regulation by the Commission shall not apply to rural 
electric cooperatives which comply with paragraph 3 of this subsection. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. To be exempt under paragraph 2 of this subsection 
from all Commission regulation, except as provided for in this section, a 
cooperative shall poll its members as follows: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. an election under this subsection may be called by 
the Board of Trustees or shall be called not less than one hundred eighty (180) 
days after receipt of a valid petition signed by not less than five percent (5%) 
of the members of the cooperative, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the proposition for deregulation shall be 
presented to a meeting of the members, the notice of which shall set forth the 
proposition for deregulation and the time and place of the meeting. Notice to 
the members shall be written and delivered not less than twenty-one (21) nor 
more than forty-five (45) days before the date of the meeting, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. if the cooperative mails information to its 
members regarding the proposition for deregulation other than notice of the 
election and the ballot, the cooperative shall also include in such mailing any 
information in opposition to the proposition that is submitted by petition 
signed by not less than one percent (1%) of the cooperative's members, 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. if the proposition for deregulation is approved by 
the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the members voting on the 
proposition, the cooperative shall notify the state Corporation Commission in 
writing of the results within ten (10) days after the date of the election, and 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. voting on the proposition for deregulation shall 
be by mail ballot, provided, members attending the meeting provided for in 
subparagraph b of this paragraph may execute and deliver their ballot to the 
cooperative during or at the conclusion of said meeting. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. In the event the member-consumers have voted, 
pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection, to exempt themselves from regulation 
by the Commission, any such cooperative may vote no more than once every twelve 
(12) months to place said cooperative under the regulation of the Commission, as 
provided in this section. Said question shall be submitted to the 
member-consumers of the rural electric cooperative if at least five percent (5%) 
of the members of the cooperative sign a petition requesting such an election. 
Such petition shall be submitted to the membership in the same manner as 
provided for in paragraph 3 of this subsection. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Each rural electric cooperative which has voted to 
exempt itself from Commission regulation , when determining how rates and 
charges established after such exemption are to be allocated to the different 
rate classes, shall apportion such rates and charges in a manner which reflects, 
as closely as practicable, the costs of providing service to that class. Each 
cooperative which has exempted itself from Commission regulation shall file and 
maintain a copy of all current rates and charges with the Oklahoma Corporation 
Commission. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. In no event, and under no circumstances, shall 
rates and charges established hereunder be utilized for the purpose of 
establishing special competitive rates in any area in which a cooperative is in 
direct competition with another regulated retail utility supplier. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, 
the Commission shall retain jurisdiction over all cooperatives who have voted to 
exempt themselves from Commission regulation : </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. for all purposes relating to certified territories 
established under the Retail Electric Supplier Certified Territory Act, and 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. for proceedings brought by a regulated utility 
relating to alleged discriminatory or anti-competitive rates established by an 
exempt cooperative, or relating to actions to acquire existing customers of a 
regulated utility using such rates </FONT></P>
