<p>7. Investigate alleged violations of the Oklahoma Petroleum Storage Tank Consolidation Act. Employ, authorize or designate personnel to conduct inquiries, investigations, inspections, and to perform other acts that the Director of the Petroleum Storage Tank Division is authorized or required to conduct or perform, to make reports of compliance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Petroleum Storage Tank Consolidation Act and rules promulgated pursuant thereto;</p>

<p>8. Within its discretion, report and request criminal prosecution proceedings to the district attorney having jurisdiction or to the Attorney General any act committed by any person, entity, owner, operator, employee or agent of a facility which may constitute a violation of the provisions of the Oklahoma Petroleum Storage Tank Consolidation Act, any order issued or rules promulgated pursuant thereto;</p>

<p>9. Advise, consult, assist, and cooperate with other agencies of this state, towns, cities, counties, industries, the federal government, other states and interstate agencies and with affected groups and political subdivisions regarding petroleum storage tank issues;</p>

<p>a. submit such reports and information concerning the storage tank system as may be determined necessary by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Petroleum Storage Tank Consolidation Act or rules promulgated pursuant thereto,</p>

<p>b. perform tests, install release detection devices, and where appropriate, monitor the environment to ensure that a petroleum release is not occurring,</p>

<p>c. make timely reports to the Commission of contamination, releases, or testing and sampling events at or above Commission action levels,</p>

<p>d. temporarily or permanently cease operation of a storage tank system, modify and immediately remove or control any regulated substance that is found to be causing contamination when such cessation, removal or control is determined to be necessary by the Commission,</p>

<p>e. provide an alternate or temporary drinking water source to any person deprived of drinking water if it is found that such owner or operator is responsible for contaminating the drinking water source beyond applicable drinking water standards, or where no such standard exists, such standard as the Department of Environmental Quality shall determine,</p>

<p>f. take full corrective action if such owner or operator or other such responsible person is found to be responsible for the release, and</p>

<p>g. take appropriate action to temporarily relocate residents affected by the release;</p>
