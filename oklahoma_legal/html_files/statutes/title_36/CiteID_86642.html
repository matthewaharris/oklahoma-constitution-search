foreign country as a condition of doing business therein, "clearing corporation" 
may include a corporation which is organized or existing under the laws of any

<P>5. "Federal Reserve book-entry system" shall mean the computerized systems

<P>B. 1. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a domestic insurance 
company may deposit or arrange for the deposit of securities held in or 
purchased for its general account and its separate accounts in a clearing 
corporation or the Federal Reserve book-entry system. When securities are 
deposited with a clearing corporation, certificates representing securities of 
the same class of the same issuer may be merged and held in bulk in the name of 
the nominee of the clearing corporation with any other securities deposited with 
the clearing corporation by any person, regardless of the ownership of the 
securities, and certificates representing securities of small denominations may 
be merged into one or more certificates of larger denominations. The records of 
any agent through which an insurance company holds securities in the Federal 
Reserve book-entry system, and the records of any custodian banks through which 
an insurance company holds securities in a clearing corporation, shall at all 
times show that the securities are held for the insurance company and for which 
accounts thereof.</P>
<P>b. Ownership of, and other interests in, the securities may be transferred by 
bookkeeping entry on the books of the clearing corporation or in the Federal 
Reserve book-entry system without, in either case, physical delivery of 
certificates representing such securities; and </P>
<P>2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, securities eligible for 
deposit under the Oklahoma Insurance Code relating to deposit of securities by 
an insurance company as a condition of commencing or continuing to do an 
insurance business in this state may be deposited with a clearing corporation or 
held in the Federal Reserve book-entry system and used to meet the deposit 
requirements under the Oklahoma Insurance Code and shall be under the control of 
the Commissioner and shall not be withdrawn by the insurance company without the 
approval of the Commissioner. Any insurance company holding securities in this 
manner shall provide to the Commissioner evidence issued by its custodian or an 
agent through which the insurance company has deposited securities with a 
clearing corporation or held in the Federal Reserve book-entry system, 
respectively, in order to establish that the securities are actually recorded in 
an account in the name of the custodian or agent and evidence that the records 
of the custodian or agent reflect that the securities are held subject to the 
order of the Commissioner.</P>
<P>C. 1. An insurance company may, by written agreement with a custodian, 
provide for the custody of its securities with a custodian, which securities may 
be held by the custodian or its agent or in a clearing corporation or in the 
Federal Reserve book-entry system. Securities so held, whether held by the 
custodian or its agent or in a clearing corporation or in the Federal Reserve 
book-entry system, are referred to herein as "custodied securities";</P>
<P>2. Any such agreement shall be in writing and shall be authorized by a 
resolution of the board of directors of the insurance company or of an 
authorized committee thereof. The terms of the agreement shall comply with the 
following:</P>
<P>a. certified securities held by the custodian shall be held either separate 
from the securities of the custodian and of all of its other customers or in a 
fungible bulk of securities as part of a Filing of Securities by Issue (FOSBI) 
arrangement,</P>
<P>b. securities held in a fungible bulk by the custodian and securities in a 
clearing corporation or in the Federal Reserve book-entry system shall be 
separately identified on the custodian's official records as being owned by the 
insurance company. The records shall identify which custodied securities are 
held by the custodian or by its agent and which securities are in a clearing 
corporation or in the Federal Reserve book-entry system. If the securities are 
in a clearing corporation or in the Federal Reserve book-entry system, the 
records shall also identify where the securities are and if in a clearing 
corporation, the name of the clearing corporation and if through an agent, the 
name of the agent,</P>
<P>c. all custodied securities that are registered shall be registered in the 
name of the company or in the name of a nominee of the company or in the name of 
the custodian or its nominee or, if in a clearing corporation, in the name of 
the clearing corporation or its nominee,</P>
<P>d. custodied securities shall be held subject to the instructions of the 
insurance company and shall be withdrawable upon the demand of the insurance 
company, except that custodied securities used to meet the deposit requirements 
set forth in the Insurance Code shall, to the extent required by the Code, be 
under the control of the Commissioner and shall not be withdrawn by the 
insurance company without the approval of the Commissioner,</P>
<P>e. the custodian shall be required to send or cause to be sent to the 
insurance company a confirmation of all transfers of custodied securities to or 
from the account of the insurance company. In addition, the custodian shall be 
required to furnish the insurance company with reports of holdings of custodied 
securities at such times and containing such information as may be reasonably 
requested by the insurance company,</P>
<P>f. during the course of the custodian's regular business hours, any officer 
or employee of the insurance company, any independent accountant selected by the 
insurance company, and any representative of an appropriate regulatory body 
shall be entitled to examine, on the premises of the custodian, the custodian's 
records relating to custodied securities, but only upon furnishing the custodian 
with written instructions to that effect from an appropriate officer of the 
insurance company,</P>
<P>g. the custodian and its agents shall be required to send to the insurance 
company</P>
<P>(1) all reports which they receive from a clearing corporation or the Federal 
Reserve book-entry system on their respective systems of internal accounting 
control, and</P>
<P>(2) any reports prepared by outside auditors on the custodian's or its 
agents' internal accounting control of custodied securities that the insurance 
company may reasonably request,</P>
<P>h. the custodian shall maintain records sufficient to determine and verify 
information relating to custodied securities that may be reported in the 
insurance company's annual statement and supporting schedules and information 
required in any audit of the financial statements of the insurance company,</P>
<P>i. the custodian shall provide, upon written request from an appropriate 
officer of the insurance company, the appropriate affidavits, substantially in 
the form provided in subsections F, G and H of this section, with respect to 
custodied securities,</P>
<P>j. the custodian shall be obligated to indemnify the insurance company for 
any loss of custodied securities occasioned by the negligence or dishonesty of 
the custodian's officers and employees, or burglary, robbery, holdup, theft or 
mysterious disappearance, including loss by damage or destruction,</P>
<P>k. in the event that there is a loss of custodied securities for which the 
custodian shall be obligated to indemnify the insurance company as provided in 
subparagraph j of this paragraph, the custodian shall promptly replace the 
securities or the value thereof and the value of any loss of rights or 
privileges resulting from said loss of securities,</P>
<P>l. the agreement may provide that the custodian will not be liable for any 
failure to take any action required to be taken under the agreement in the event 
and to the extent that the taking of such action is prevented or delayed by war 
(whether declared or not and including existing wars), revolution, insurrection, 
riot, civil commotion, act of God, accident, fire, explosion, stoppage of labor, 
strikes or other differences with employees, laws, regulations, orders or other 
acts of any governmental authority, or any other cause whatever beyond its 
reasonable control, and</P>
<P>m. in the event that the custodian gains entry in a clearing corporation or 
in the Federal Reserve book-entry system through an agent, there shall be an 
agreement between the custodian and the agent under which the agent shall be 
subject to the same liability for loss of custodied securities as the custodian, 
provided, however, that, if the agent shall be subject to regulation under the 
laws of a jurisdiction which is different from the jurisdiction the laws of 
which regulate the custodian, the Commissioner may accept a standard of 
liability applicable to the agent which is different from the standard of 
liability applicable to the custodian.</P>
<P>D. A company may loan stocks or obligations held by it pursuant to the 
provisions of this act to a broker-dealer registered under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 or a member bank. The loan must be evidenced by a written 
agreement which provides that:</P>
<P>1. The loan will be fully collateralized by cash or obligations issued or 
guaranteed by the United States or an agency or an instrumentality thereof, and 
the collateral will be adjusted each business day during the term of the loan to 
maintain the required collateralization in the event of market value changes in 
the loaned securities or collateral;</P>
<P>2. The loan may be terminated by the company at any time, and the borrower 
will return the loaned stocks or obligations or their equivalent within five (5) 
business days after termination; and</P>
<P>3. The company has the right to retain the collateral or use the collateral 
to purchase investments equivalent to the loaned securities if the borrower 
defaults under the terms of the agreement and the borrower remains liable for 
any losses and expenses incurred by the company due to default that are not 
covered by the collateral.</P>
<P>E. An investment may consist of an individual interest in a pool of 
obligations or a fractional interest in a single obligation if the certificate 
of participation or interest or the confirmation of participation or interest in 
the investment shall be issued in the name of the company or the name of the 
custodian bank or the nominee of either and the certificate or confirmation 
must, if held by a custodian bank, be kept separate and apart from the 
investments of others so that at all times the participation may be identified 
as belonging solely to the company making the investment.</P>
<P>F. The following shall be substantially the form of custodian affidavit for 
use by a custodian bank where securities entrusted to its care have not been 
redeposited elsewhere:</P>
