<p>2. To develop uniform standards for insurance products covered under the Compact;</p>

<p>4. To give appropriate regulatory approval to those product filings and advertisements satisfying the applicable uniform standard;</p>

<p>5. To improve coordination of regulatory resources and expertise between state insurance departments regarding the setting of uniform standards and review of insurance products covered under the Compact;</p>

<p>6. To create the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission; and</p>

<p>7. To perform these and such other related functions as may be consistent with the state regulation of the business of insurance.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS</p>

<p>For purposes of this Compact:</p>

<p>1. "Advertisement" means any material designed to create public interest in a product, or induce the public to purchase, increase, modify, reinstate, borrow on, surrender, replace or retain a policy, as more specifically defined in the rules and operating procedures of the Commission;</p>

<p>2. "Bylaws" means those bylaws established by the Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling the Commissions actions or conduct;</p>

<p>3. "Compacting state" means any state which has enacted this Compact legislation and which has not withdrawn pursuant to Section 1 of Article XIV of this Compact, or been terminated pursuant to Section 2 of Article XIV of this Compact;</p>

<p>4. "Commission" means the "Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission" established by this Compact;</p>

<p>5. "Commissioner" means the chief insurance regulatory official of a state including, but not limited to, commissioner, superintendent, director or administrator;</p>

<p>7. "Insurer" means any entity licensed by a state to issue contracts of insurance for any of the lines of insurance covered by this act;</p>

<p>8. "Member" means the person chosen by a compacting state as its representative to the Commission, or his or her designee;</p>

<p>9. "Noncompacting state" means any state which is not at the time a compacting state;</p>

<p>12. "Rule" means a statement of general or particular applicability and future effect promulgated by the Commission, including a uniform standard developed pursuant to Article VII of this Compact, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of the Commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the compacting states;</p>

<p>13. "State" means any state, district or territory of the United States of America;</p>

<p>14. "Third-party filer" means an entity that submits a product filing to the Commission on behalf of an insurer; and</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE III. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION AND VENUE</p>

<p>1. The compacting states hereby create and establish a joint public agency known as the "Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission". Pursuant to Article IV of this Compact, the Commission will have the power to develop uniform standards for product lines, receive and provide prompt review of products filed therewith, and give approval to those product filings satisfying applicable uniform standards; provided, it is not intended for the Commission to be the exclusive entity for receipt and review of insurance product filings. Nothing herein shall prohibit any insurer from filing its product in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance; and any such filing shall be subject to the laws of the state where filed.</p>

<p>2. The Commission is a body corporate and politic, and an instrumentality of the compacting states.</p>

<p>3. The Commission is solely responsible for its liabilities except as otherwise specifically provided in this Compact.</p>

The Commission shall consider whether any subsequent amendments to the NAIC Long-Term Care Insurance Model Act or Long-Term Care Insurance Model Regulation adopted by the NAIC require amending of the uniform standards established by the Commission for long-term care insurance products;</p>

<p>3. To receive and review in an expeditious manner products filed with the Commission, and rate filings for disability income and long-term care insurance products, and give approval of those products and rate filings that satisfy the applicable uniform standard, where such approval shall have the force and effect of law and be binding on the compacting states to the extent and in the manner provided in the Compact;</p>

<p>4. To receive and review in an expeditious manner advertisement relating to long-term care insurance products for which uniform standards have been adopted by the Commission, and give approval to all advertisement that satisfies the applicable uniform standard.

The actions of the Commission as provided in this section shall have the force and effect of law and shall be binding in the compacting states to the extent and in the manner provided in the Compact;</p>

<p>5. To exercise its rulemaking authority and designate products and advertisement that may be subject to a self-certification process without the need for prior approval by the Commission;</p>

<p>7. To bring and prosecute legal proceedings or actions in its name as the Commission; provided, that the standing of any state insurance department to sue or be sued under applicable law shall not be affected;</p>

<p>8. To issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence;</p>

<p>9. To establish and maintain offices;</p>

<p>10. To purchase and maintain insurance and bonds;</p>

<p>11. To borrow, accept or contract for services of personnel, including, but not limited to, employees of a compacting state;</p>

<p>12.

<p>1. The Commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this Compact and the bylaws.</p>

<p>2. Each member of the Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Commission. A member shall vote in person or by such other means as provided in the bylaws. The bylaws may provide for members participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication.</p>

<p>3. The Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the bylaws.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE VII. RULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES:<br />
RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION AND<br />
OPTING OUT OF UNIFORM STANDARDS</p>

<p>1. Rulemaking Authority. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.</p>

<p>2. Rulemaking Procedure. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission. Before the Commission adopts a uniform standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee(s) in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard. The Commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.</p>

<p>3. Effective Date and Opt Out of a Uniform Standard. A uniform standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the Commission or such later date as the Commission may determine; provided, however, that a compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this Article. "Opt out" shall be defined as any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated uniform standard. All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure or amendment.</p>

<p>4. Opt Out Procedure. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the Insurance Department under the compacting states Administrative Procedure Act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by regulation, it must:</p>

<p>a. Give written notice to the Commission no later than ten (10) business days after the uniform standard is promulgated, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state; and</p>

<p>b. Find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state. The Commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The Commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh:</p>

<p>i. The intent of the Legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this act; and</p>

<p>ii. The presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, a compacting state may, at the time of its enactment of this Compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted Compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in this Compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this Compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.</p>

<p>5. Effect of Opt Out. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective.</p>

<p>Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the state. If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV of this Compact for withdrawals.</p>

<p>6. Stay of Uniform Standard. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the Commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one (1) year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the Commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.</p>

<p>7. Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule or operating procedure is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the Commissions authority.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE VIII. COMMISSION RECORDS AND ENFORCEMENT</p>

<p>1. The Commission shall promulgate rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers trade secrets. The Commission may promulgate additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.</p>

<p>2. Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state Commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the Commission; provided, that disclosure to the Commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement; and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this act, the Commission shall not be subject to the compacting states laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the Commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any Commissioner.</p>

<p>3. The Commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The Commission shall notify any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with Commission bylaws, rules or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in Article XIV of this Compact.</p>

<p>4. The Commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the states law. The Commissioners enforcement of compliance with the Compact is governed by the following provisions:</p>

<p>a. With respect to the Commissioners market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved or certified to the Commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the Compact except upon a final order of the Commission, issued at the request of a Commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the Commission.</p>

<p>b. Before a Commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the Compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to the Commission, the Commission, or an authorized Commission officer or employee, must authorize the action. However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the Commissions action on such requests.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE IX. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

<p>The Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this Compact and which may arise between two or more compacting states, or between compacting states and noncompacting states, and the Commission shall promulgate an operating procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE X. PRODUCT FILING AND APPROVAL</p>

<p>1. Insurers and third-party filers seeking to have a product approved by the Commission shall file the product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the Commission. Nothing in this act shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the insurance department in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.</p>

<p>2. The Commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to Commission rules and operating procedures. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Commission shall promulgate rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the Commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such rules, the Commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a product filing or supporting information.</p>

<p>3. Any product approved by the Commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE XI. REVIEW OF COMMISSION DECISIONS REGARDING FILINGS</p>

<p>1. Not later than thirty (30) days after the Commission has given notice of a disapproved product or advertisement filed with the Commission, the insurer or third-party filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the Commission. The Commission shall promulgate rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the Commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the Commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with Section 4 of Article III of this Compact.</p>

<p>2. The Commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the Commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in Section 1 of this article.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE XII. FINANCE</p>

<p>1. The Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the Commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, compacting states and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the Commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.</p>

<p>2. The Commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third-party filer filing a product with the Commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the Commissions annual budget.</p>

<p>3. The Commissions budget for a fiscal year shall not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in Article VII of this Compact.</p>

<p>4. The Commission shall be exempt from all taxation in and by the compacting states.</p>

<p>5. The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any compacting state, except by and with the appropriate legal authority of that compacting state.</p>

<p>6. The Commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements of all funds under its control. The internal financial accounts of the Commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its bylaws. The financial accounts and reports including the system of internal controls and procedures of the Commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. Upon the determination of the Commission, but no less frequently than every three (3) years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the Commission. The Commission shall make an annual report to the Governor and Legislature of the compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The Commissions internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the Commissioner of any compacting state upon request; provided, however, that any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.</p>

<p>7. No compacting state shall have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the Commission or to any Commission funds held pursuant to the provisions of this Compact.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE XIII. COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT</p>

<p>1. Any state is eligible to become a compacting state.</p>

<p>2. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by two compacting states; provided, the Commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting uniform standards for, reviewing, and giving approval or disapproval of, products filed with the Commission that satisfy applicable uniform standards only after twenty-six (26) states are compacting states or, alternatively, by states representing greater than forty percent (40%) of the premium volume for life insurance, annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance products, based on records of the NAIC for the prior year. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the Compact into law by that state.</p>

<p>3. Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Commission and the compacting states unless and until all compacting states enact the amendment into law.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE XIV. WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT AND TERMINATION</p>

<p>1. Withdrawal</p>

<p>a. Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the Compact ("withdrawing state") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.</p>

<p>b. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the Commission and the withdrawing state unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in paragraph e of this section.</p>

<p>c. The Commissioner of the withdrawing state shall immediately notify the Management Committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the withdrawing state.</p>

<p>d. The Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the introduction of such legislation within ten (10) days after its receipt of notice thereof.</p>

<p>e. The withdrawing state is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the Commission and the withdrawing state. The Commissions approval of products and advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the withdrawing state, unless formally rescinded by the withdrawing state in the same manner as provided by the laws of the withdrawing state for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.</p>

<p>f. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the effective date of the withdrawing state reenacting the Compact.</p>

<p>2. Default</p>

<p>a. If the Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted ("defaulting state") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the bylaws or duly promulgated rules or operating procedures, then, after notice and hearing as set forth in the bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact on the defaulting state shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the Commission. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in Commission rules. The Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the defaulting states suspension pending a cure of the default. The Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the Compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.</p>

<p>b. Product approvals by the Commission or product self-certifications, or any advertisement in connection with such product, that is in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the defaulting state in the same manner as if the defaulting state had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to Section 1 of this article.</p>

<p>c. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires a reenactment of the Compact.</p>

<p>3. Dissolution of Compact</p>

<p>a. The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the Compact to one compacting state.</p>

<p>b. Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE XV. SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION</p>

<p>1. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.</p>

<p>2. The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>

<p align="center">ARTICLE XVI. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS</p>

<p>1. Other Laws</p>

<p>a. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state, except as provided in paragraph b of this section.</p>

<p>b. For any product approved or certified to the Commission, the rules, uniform standards and any other requirements of the Commission shall constitute the exclusive provisions applicable to the content, approval and certification of such products. For advertisement that is subject to the Commissions authority, any rule, uniform standard or other requirement of the Commission which governs the content of the advertisement shall constitute the exclusive provision that a Commissioner may apply to the content of the advertisement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action taken by the Commission shall abrogate or restrict:</p>

<p>i. the access of any person to state courts,</p>

<p>ii. remedies available under state law related to breach of contract, tort, or other laws not specifically directed to the content of the product,</p>

<p>iii. state law relating to the construction of insurance contracts, or</p>

<p>iv. the authority of the Attorney General of the state including, but not limited to, maintaining any actions or proceedings, as authorized by law.</p>

<p>c. All insurance products filed with individual states shall be subject to the laws of those states.</p>

<p>2. Binding Effect of this Compact</p>

<p>a. All lawful actions of the Commission, including all rules and operating procedures promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.</p>

<p>b. All agreements between the Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.</p>

<p>c. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over the meaning or interpretation of Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation in dispute.</p>

<p>d. In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the Legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by that provision upon the Commission shall be ineffective as to that compacting state, and those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.</p>
