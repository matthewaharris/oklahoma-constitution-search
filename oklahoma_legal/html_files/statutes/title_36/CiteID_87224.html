qualified actuary shall be defined in rules by the Commissioner.</P>

other material may otherwise be released by the Commissioner as follows:</P>
<P>(1) with the written consent of the company, or</P>
<P>(2) to the American Academy of Actuaries upon request stating that the 
memorandum or other material is required for the purpose of professional 
disciplinary proceedings and setting forth procedures satisfactory to the

associated with the policies and contracts.</P>

domiciled in this state,</P>
<P>f. except in cases of fraud or willful misconduct, the appointed actuary

and the Commissioner, for any act, error, omission, decision or conduct with 
respect to the appointed actuary's opinion, and</P>
