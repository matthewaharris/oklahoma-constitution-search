<P>No policy of group life insurance shall be delivered in this state unless it conforms to one of the following descriptions:</P>
<P>1. A policy issued to an employer, or to the trustees of a fund established by an employer, which employer or trustees shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure employees of the employer for the benefit of persons other than the employer, subject to the following requirements:</P>
<P>a. The employees eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the employees of the employer, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment. The policy may provide that the term "employees" shall include the employees of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the employees, individual proprietors and partners of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships if the business of the employer and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership or contract, or otherwise. The policy may provide that the term "employees" shall include the individual proprietor or partners if the employer is an individual proprietor or a partnership. The policy may provide that the term "employees" shall include retired employees. No director of a corporate employer shall be eligible for insurance under the policy unless such a person is otherwise eligible as a bona fide employee of the corporation by performing services other than the usual duties of a director. No individual proprietor or partner shall be eligible for insurance under the policy unless he is actively engaged in and devotes a substantial part of his time to the conduct of the business of the proprietor or partnership. The policy may provide that the term "employees" shall include the trustees or their employees, or both, if their duties are principally connected with such trusteeship. A policy issued to insure the employees of a public body may provide that the term "employee" shall include elected or appointed officials.</P>
<P>b. The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either wholly from the employer's funds or funds contributed by him, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured employees, or from funds contributed wholly by the insured employees. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured employees must insure all eligible employees, or all except any as to whom evidence of insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.</P>
<P>c. The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the employees or by the employer or trustee;</P>
<P>2. A policy issued to a creditor, who shall be deemed to be the policyholder, to insure debtors of the creditor. Credit unions and associations formed for the purpose of making loans to their members shall be deemed to be creditors within the meaning of this section. Policies issued to a creditor to insure debtors of the creditor are subject to the following requirements:</P>
<P>a. The debtors eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the debtors of the creditor or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to the indebtedness or to the purchase giving rise to the indebtedness. The policy may provide that the term "debtors" shall include the debtors of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the debtors of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships if the business of the policyholder and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership, contract or otherwise.</P>
<P>b. The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the creditor's funds, or from charges collected from the insured debtors, or from both. A policy on which part or all of the premium is to be derived from the collection from the insured debtors of identifiable charges not required of uninsured debtors shall not include, in the class or classes of debtors eligible for insurance, debtors under obligation outstanding at its date of issue without evidence of individual insurability unless at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the then eligible debtors elect to pay the required charges. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from the collection of such identifiable charges must insure all eligible debtors, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.</P>
<P>c. The policy may be issued only if the group of eligible debtors is then receiving new entrants at the rate of at least one hundred persons yearly, or may reasonably be expected to receive at least one hundred new entrants during the first policy year, and only if the policy reserves to the insurer the right to require evidence of individual insurability if less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the new entrants become insured.</P>
<P>d. The amount of insurance on the life of any debtor shall at no time exceed the amount owed by him which is repayable to the creditor, or One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), whichever is less, provided further, no company licensed to do business in this state shall issue in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) group credit life insurance on one individual in the State of Oklahoma.</P>
<P>e. The insurance shall be payable to the policyholder. Such payment shall reduce or extinguish the unpaid indebtedness of the debtor to the extent of such payment;</P>
<P>3. A policy issued to a labor union, which shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure members of such union for the benefit of persons other than the union or any of its officials, representatives or agents, subject to the following requirements:</P>
<P>a. The members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the members of the union, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment, or to membership in the union, or both.</P>
<P>b. The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either wholly from the union's funds, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance, or from funds contributed wholly by the insured members. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.</P>
<P>c. The amount of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the union;</P>
<P>4. A policy issued to the trustees of a fund established in this state by two or more employers in the same industry, provided a majority of the employees to be insured of each employer are located within this state, or to the trustees of a fund established by one or more labor unions, or by one or more employers in the same industry and one or more labor unions or by one or more employers and one or more labor unions whose members are in the same or related occupation or trades, or by an association of persons, licensed by the State of Oklahoma to engage in a recognized profession, which trustees shall be deemed the policyholder to insure employees of the employers or members of the unions or members of an association of persons, licensed by the State of Oklahoma to engage in a recognized profession, for the benefit of persons other than the employers or the unions, or the association of persons, licensed by the State of Oklahoma to engage in a recognized profession, subject to the following requirements:</P>
<P>a. The persons eligible for insurance shall be all of the employees of the employers or all of the members of the union, or all the members of an association of persons, licensed by the State of Oklahoma to engage in a recognized profession, or all of any class or classes thereof determined by conditions pertaining to their employment, or to membership in the unions, or to both, or pertaining to membership in the association of persons, licensed by the State of Oklahoma to engage in a recognized profession. The policy may provide that the term "employees" shall include the individual proprietor or partners if any employer is an individual proprietor or a partnership. The policy may provide that the term "employees" shall include retired employees. No director of a corporate employer shall be eligible for insurance under the policy unless such person is otherwise eligible as a bona fide employee of the corporation by performing services other than the usual duties of a director. No individual proprietor or a partner shall be eligible for insurance under the policy unless he is actively engaged in and devotes a substantial part of his time to the conduct of the business of the proprietor or partnership. The policy may provide that the term "employees" shall include the trustees or their employees, or both if their duties are principally connected with such trusteeship, and that the term "members of an association" shall include employees of members.</P>
<P>b. The premium for the policy shall be paid by the trustees wholly from funds contributed by the employer or employers of the insured persons, or by the union or unions, or by both, or by an association of persons, licensed by the State of Oklahoma to engage in a recognized profession, or from funds contributed wholly or in part by the insured persons. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured persons specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible persons, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.</P>
<P>c. The policy must cover at date of issue at least one hundred persons; and if the fund is established by the members of an association of employers the policy may be issued only if (a) either (i) the participating employers constitute at date of issue at least sixty percent (60%) of those employer members whose employees are not already covered by group life insurance or (ii) the total number of persons covered at date of issue exceeds six hundred; and (b) the policy shall not require that if a participating employer discontinues membership in the association, the insurance of his employees shall cease solely by reason of such discontinuance.</P>
<P>d. The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the insured persons or by the policyholder, employers, or unions;</P>
<P>5. A policy issued to any nonprofit industrial association to insure the executives of employer members of a nonprofit industrial association, which is now and has been actively functioning for a period of not less than ten (10) years, such policy to be issued to such association which shall be deemed to be the employer for the purposes of this article, or to the association and executives of such employer members jointly and insuring only all of such executives for amounts of insurance based upon some plan which will preclude individual selection, for the benefit of persons other than such association, and the premium on which shall be paid by the employer members or the employer members and the executives of such employer members jointly;</P>
<P>6. A policy issued to a credit union which shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure eligible members for the benefit of someone other than the credit union or its officials and subject to the following requirements:</P>
<P>a. The members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all the members of the credit union or all of any class or classes thereof.</P>
<P>b. The premiums for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either wholly from the credit union's funds, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.</P>
<P>c. The amount of insurance under the policy may be based on the amount of the member's savings in the credit union or upon some other plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the credit union;</P>
<P>7. A policy issued to a charitable, benevolent, educational or religious institution, or their agencies, to insure the members thereof for the purpose set forth in subsection D of Section 3604 of this title;</P>
<P>8. A policy issued to an alumni association of an institution of higher education accredited by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, to insure the members thereof for the purpose set forth in subsection E of Section 3604 of this title;</P>
<P>9. A policy to an association, which has a constitution and bylaws and which has been organized and is maintained in good faith for purposes other than that of obtaining insurance, that insures at least ten members, employees, or employees of members of the association or its officers or trustees. The term "employees" as used in this paragraph shall include retired employees.</P>
<P>"Association" means, with respect to life insurance coverage offered, an association which:</P>
<P>a. has been actively in existence for at least five (5) years,</P>
<P>b. has been formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining insurance,</P>
<P>c. does not condition membership in the association on any health status-related factor relating to an individual, including an employee of an employer or a dependent of an employee or association member,</P>
<P>d. makes life insurance coverage offered through the association available to all members regardless of any health status-related factor relating to such member or individuals eligible for coverage through a member,</P>
<P>e. does not make life insurance coverage offered through the association available other than in connection with a member of the association, and</P>
<P>f. meets such additional requirements as may be imposed under state law;</P>
<P>10. A policy issued to cover any other group subject to the following requirements:</P>
<P>a. no such group life insurance policy shall be delivered in this state unless the Commissioner of Insurance finds that:</P>
<P>(1) the issuance of such group policy is not contrary to the best interest of the public,</P>
<P>(2) the issuance of the group policy would result in economies of acquisition or administration, and</P>
<P>(3) the benefits are reasonable in relation to the premiums charged, and</P>
<P>b. the premium for the policy shall be paid either from the policyholders funds or from funds contributed by the covered person or from both; or</P>
<P>11. A policy issued to cover any other substantially similar group which, in the discretion of the Insurance Commissioner, may be subject to the issuance of a group life policy or contract.</P>
