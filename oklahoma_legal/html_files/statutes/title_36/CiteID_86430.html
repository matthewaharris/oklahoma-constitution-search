<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In accordance with the purpose expressed in Section 1 
of this act, insurers, agents of insurers, representatives of insurers and 
brokers shall be subject to the following prohibitions and 
regulations:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. No insurer, agent of an insurer or representative 
of an insurer shall deliver within this state, or issue for delivery within this 
state, any policy of life insurance or annuity contract which uses as its name 
or title a phrase which does not include the words, "Life Insurance" or "Annuity 
Contract" unless such phrase is accompanied by other language elsewhere in the 
policy or contract which indicates that it is a life insurance policy or annuity 
contract;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The use of the terms "Investment," "Investment 
Plan," "Expansion Plan," "Profit," "Profit-sharing" and similar terms in 
connection with a policy of life insurance or an annuity contract, in a context 
or under such circumstances or conditions as to have the capacity or tendency to 
mislead a purchaser or prospective purchaser of such policy or contract to 
believe that he will receive, or that it is possible that he will receive, 
something other than a life insurance policy or annuity contract or some benefit 
not provided in the policy or contract or some benefit not available to other 
persons of the same class and equal expectation of life, is unlawful and is 
prohibited;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. No insurer, agent or broker shall within this 
state:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. make any statement or reference relating to the 
growth of the life insurance industry in connection with any solicitation of an 
application for life insurance or annuity contract in a context which could 
reasonably be understood to interest a prospect in the purchase of shares of 
stock in an insurer rather than in the purchase of a life insurance policy or 
annuity contract,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. make any statement which reasonably gives rise to 
the inference that an insured or a prospective insured, by virtue of purchasing 
a policy of life insurance or an annuity contract, will enjoy a status common to 
a stockholder or will acquire a stock ownership interest in the insurer; 
provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to prohibit the 
practice of pointing out those aspects in which the status of a policyholder in 
a mutual life insurer is similar to that of a stockholder in a stock life 
insurer,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. make any reference to or statement concerning an 
insurer's "Investment Department," "Insured Investment Department" or similar 
terminology, in such a manner as to imply that the policy was sold or issued by 
the investment department of the life insurer,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. make any statement or reference which would 
reasonably tend to imply that, by purchasing a policy, the purchaser or 
prospective purchaser will become a member of a limited group of persons who may 
receive special advantages or favored treatment in the payment of dividends, 
unless such benefits are specifically provided in the insurance contract. This 
paragraph shall not apply to policies under which insured persons of one class 
of risk may receive dividends at a higher rate than persons of another class of 
risk,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. state or imply that a particular kind of policy is 
available for only a limited time or that only a limited number of a particular 
kind of policy will be offered for sale or that only a limited number of 
persons, or a limited class of persons, will be eligible to buy a particular 
kind of policy, unless such limitation is specifically provided in the insurance 
contract,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. state or imply that policyholders who are said to 
act as "centers of influence" or as an advisory board for an insurer will share, 
because of so acting, in the insurer's surplus earnings in some manner not 
available to other policyholders who are otherwise in the same class,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>g. describe or refer to premium payments in language 
which states that the payment is a "deposit" unless:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>the payment sets up a debtor-creditor relationship 
between the life insurance company and the policyholder and a showing is made as 
to when and how the deposit may be withdrawn </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>the term is used in conjunction with the word" 
premium" in such a manner as to indicate clearly the true character of the 
payment, or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>the term is used in connection with pension trust or 
deposit administration plans,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>h. use the words "dividends," "cash dividends," 
"surplus" or similar phrases in such a manner as to state or imply that the 
payment of dividends is guaranteed or certain to occur</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>i. state or imply that a purchaser of a policy will 
share in a stated percentage or portion of the earnings of the insurer. Nothing 
in this paragraph is intended to prohibit a representation that a holder of a 
participating life insurance policy or annuity contract will participate in the 
share of the divisible surplus, if any, apportioned to the policy or contract by 
the insurer,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>j. make any statement or implication that dividends 
under a participating policy will be sufficient at any time to assure the 
receipt of benefits, such as a paid-up policy, without the further payment of 
premiums, unless the statement is accompanied by an adequate explanation as to 
what benefits or coverage would be provided at such time and the conditions 
under which this would occur,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>k. state that the insured is guaranteed certain 
benefits if the policy is allowed to lapse without making an adequate 
explanation of the nonforfeiture benefits,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>l. describe a life insurance policy or annuity 
contract or premium payments therefor in terms of "units of participation" 
unless accompanied by other language clearly indicating the reference to a life 
insurance policy or annuity contract or to premium payments, as the case 
maybe,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>m. include in sales kits and prepared sales 
presentations proposed answers to a prospect's questions as to whether life 
insurance policies or annuity contracts are being sold, which are designed to 
avoid a clear and unequivocal statement that life insurance or annuities are the 
subject matter of the solicitation,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>n. display in any manner to a prospective 
policyholder any material which includes illustrations, using dollar amounts, in 
connection with the proposed sale of a life insurance or annuity contract unless 
the printed material clearly identifies that the subject, to which the dollar 
amounts pertain, has an economic relationship to guaranteed values and dividends 
of the policy,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>o. make any general statement that an insurer makes a 
profit as a result of policy lapses or surrenders,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>p. make comparisons to the past experience of other 
life insurers as a means of projecting possible experience of the soliciting 
insurer when those comparisons are designed to enhance the characteristics of 
the policy being sold by confining the comparisons to insurers having favorable 
experience with that type of policy without a fair disclosure of other insurers 
which have had unfavorable experience with such type of policy,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>q. state that a policy contains certain features 
which are not found in other life insurance policies or annuity contracts, 
unless that be true,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>r. represent an option to purchase insurance in the 
future in such a manner that the policyholder might reasonably infer that he is 
purchasing term insurance or some other form of life insurance that would result 
in a payment to the beneficiary in the event of the death of the policyholder, 
or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>s. make any reference to a policy of life insurance 
or an annuity contract in such a manner as to misrepresent the true nature of 
the policy contract;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. No insurer, agent for an insurer or representative 
for an insurer shall, as a competitive or "twisting" device, inform any 
policyholder or prospective policyholder that any other insurer is required to 
change a policy form or related material to comply with the provisions of this 
act; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. This section shall not apply to group insurance 
policies nor to group annuity contracts.</FONT></P><B><I>
