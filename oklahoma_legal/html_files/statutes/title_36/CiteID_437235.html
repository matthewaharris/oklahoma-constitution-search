<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The printed form of a policy of fire insurance as 
set forth in subsection G of this section shall be known and designated as the 
standard fire insurance policy to be used in the State of Oklahoma.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Except as provided in subsection F of this 
section, no policy or contract of fire insurance shall be made, issued or 
delivered by any insurer or by any agent or representative thereof, on any 
property in the state, unless it shall conform as to all provisions, 
stipulations, agreements and conditions, with such form of policy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There shall be printed at the head of said policy the 
name of the insurer or insurers issuing the policy; the location of the home 
office or United States Office thereof; a statement as to whether said insurer 
or insurers are stock or mutual corporations or are reciprocal insurers or 
Lloyd's underwriters; and there may be added to the policy such device or 
devices as the insurer or insurers issuing said policy shall desire. Any company 
organized under special charter provisions may so indicate upon its policy, and 
may add to the policy a statement of the plan under which it operates in this 
state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the policy is issued by a mutual, cooperative or 
reciprocal insurer having special regulations with respect to the payment by the 
policyholder of assessments, such regulations shall be made a part of the 
policy, and any such insurer may print upon the policy such regulations as may 
be appropriate to or required by its home state or its form of 
organization.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There may also be added a statement of the group 
insurers with which the insurer is financially affiliated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In lieu of the facsimile signatures of the president 
and secretary of the insurer there may be used the name or names of such 
officers or managers as are authorized to execute the contract.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Appropriate forms of additional contracts, riders 
or endorsements, insuring against indirect or consequential loss or damage or 
against any one or more perils other than those of fire and lightning, or 
providing coverage which the insurer issuing the policy is authorized by charter 
and by the laws of this state to assume or issue, may be issued in connection 
with the standard fire policy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Such other perils or coverages may include those 
excluded in the standard fire insurance policy, and may include any of the 
perils or coverages permitted to be insured against or issued by property and 
casualty insurers. Such forms of contracts, riders and endorsements may contain 
provisions and stipulations inconsistent with such standard fire insurance 
policy, if said provisions and stipulations are applicable only to such 
additional coverage or to the additional peril or perils insured 
against.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Provisions to be contained on the first page of 
the policy may be rewritten, supplemented, or rearranged to facilitate policy 
issuance and to include matter which may otherwise properly be added by 
endorsement.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The pages of the standard fire insurance policy may 
be renumbered and the format rearranged for convenience in the preparation of 
individual contracts, and to provide space for the listing of rates and premiums 
for coverages insured hereunder or under endorsements attached or printed 
thereon, and such other data as may be conveniently included for duplication on 
daily reports for office records.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. There may be printed upon the standard fire policy 
the words "Standard Fire Insurance Policy for Oklahoma", and there may be 
inserted before and after the word "Oklahoma" a designation of any state or 
states in which such form of policy is standard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There may be endorsed on any such policy the name, 
with the word "agent" or "agents" and place of business, or any insurance agent 
or agents either by writing, printing, stamping or otherwise.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this section, the Insurance Commissioner may approve for use 
within the state any form of policy with variations in terms and conditions from 
the standard fire insurance policy provided for in this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. The form of the standard fire insurance policy, 
with permission to substitute for the word "company" a more accurate descriptive 
term for the type of insurer, shall be as follows:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>(FIRST PAGE OF) STANDARD FIRE INSURANCE 
POLICY</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>NO.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(Space for insertion of name of company or companies 
issuing the policy and other matter permitted to be stated at the head of the 
policy.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(Space for listing amounts of insurance, rates and 
premiums for the basic coverages insured under the standard form of policy and 
for additional coverages or perils insured under endorsements attached.) IN 
CONSIDERATION OF THE PROVISIONS AND STIPULATIONS HEREIN OR ADDED HERETO AND OF 
the premium above specified, this Company, for the term of</FONT></P>

actual cash value of the property at the time of loss, but not exceeding the 
amount which it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of 
like kind and quality within a reasonable time after such loss, without 
allowance for any increased cost of repair or reconstruction by reason of any 
ordinance or law regulating construction or repair, and without compensation for 
loss resulting from interruption of business or manufacture, nor in any event 
for more than the interest of the insured, against all DIRECT LOSS BY FIRE, 
LIGHTNING AND BY REMOVAL FROM PREMISES ENDANGERED BY THE PERILS INSURED AGAINST 
IN THIS POLICY, EXCEPT AS HEREINAFTER PROVIDED, to the property described 
hereinafter while located or contained as described in this policy, or pro rata 
for five days at each proper place to which any of the property shall 
necessarily be removed for preservation from the perils insured against in this 
policy, but not elsewhere.</FONT></P>

hereby made a part of this policy, together with such other provisions,

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Concealment, fraud. This entire policy shall be void 
if, whether before or after a loss, the insured has willfully concealed or 
misrepresented any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or 
the subject thereof, or the interest of the insured therein, or in case of any 
fraud or false swearing by the insured relating thereto.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Uninsurable and excepted property. This policy shall 
not cover accounts, bills, currency, deeds, evidences of debt, money or 
securities; nor, unless specifically named hereon in writing, bullion or 
manuscripts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Perils not included. This Company shall not be liable 
for loss by fire or other perils insured against in this policy caused, directly 
or indirectly, by: (a) enemy attack by armed forces, including action taken by 
military, naval or air forces in resisting an actual or an immediately impending 
enemy attack; (b) invasion; (c) insurrection; (d) rebellion; (e) revolution; (f) 
civil war; (g) usurped power; (h) order of any civil authority except acts of 
destruction at the time of and for the purpose of preventing the spread of fire, 
provided that such fire did not originate from any of the perils excluded by 
this policy; (i) neglect of the insured to use all reasonable means to save and 
preserve the property at and after a loss, or when the property is endangered by 
fire in neighboring premises; (j) nor shall this Company be liable for loss by 
theft.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Other Insurance. Other Insurance may be prohibited or 
the amount of insurance may be limited by endorsement attached 
hereto.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Conditions suspending or restricting insurance. 
Unless otherwise provided in writing added hereto this Company shall not be 
liable for loss occurring</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) while the hazard is increased by any means within 
the control or knowledge of the insured; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) while a described building, whether intended for 
occupancy by owner or tenant, is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of sixty 
consecutive days; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) as a result of explosion or riot, unless fire 
ensues, and in that event for loss by fire only.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Other perils or subjects. Any other peril to be 
insured against or subject of insurance to be covered in this policy shall be by 
endorsement in writing hereon or added hereto.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Added provisions. The extent of the application of 
insurance under this policy and of the contribution to be made by this Company 
in case of loss, and any other provision or agreement not inconsistent with the 
provisions of this policy, may be provided for in writing added hereto, but no 
provision may be waived except such as by the terms of this policy is subject to 
change.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Waiver provisions. No permission affecting this 
insurance shall exist, or waiver of any provision be valid, unless granted 
herein or expressed in writing added hereto. No provision, stipulation or 
forfeiture shall be held to be waived by any requirement or proceeding on the 
part of this Company relating to appraisal or to any examination provided for 
herein.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Cancellation of policy. This policy shall be canceled 
at any time at the request of the insured, in which case this Company shall, 
upon demand and surrender of this policy refund the excess of paid premium above 
the customary short rates for the expired time. This policy may be canceled at 
any time by this Company by giving to the insured a five days' written notice of 
cancellation with or without tender of the excess of paid premium above the pro 
rata premium for the expired time, which excess, if not tendered shall be 
refunded on demand. Notice of cancellation shall state that said excess premium 
(if not tendered) will be refunded on demand.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mortgagee interests and obligations. If loss 
hereunder is made payable, in whole or in part, to a designated mortgagee not 
named herein as the insured, such interest in this policy may be canceled by 
giving such mortgagee a ten days' written notice of cancellation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the insured fails to render proof of loss such 
mortgagee, upon notice, shall render proof of loss in the form herein specified 
within sixty (60) days after, and shall be subject to the provisions hereof 
relating to appraisal and time of payment and of bringing suit. If this Company 
shall claim that no liability existed as to the mortgagor or owner, it shall, to 
the extent of payment of loss to the mortgagee, be subrogated to all the 
mortgagee's rights of recovery, but without impairing mortgagee's right to sue, 
or it may pay off the mortgage debt and require an assignment thereof and of the 
mortgage. Other provisions relating to the interests and obligations of such 
mortgagee may be added hereto by agreement in writing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Pro rata liability. This Company shall not be liable 
for a greater proportion of any loss than the amount hereby insured shall bear 
to the whole insurance covering the property against the peril involved, whether 
collectible or not.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Requirements in case loss occurs. The insured shall 
give immediate written notice to this Company of any loss, protect the property 
from further damage, forthwith separate the damaged and undamaged personal 
property, put it in the best possible order, furnish a complete inventory of the 
destroyed, damaged and undamaged property, showing in detail quantities, costs, 
actual cash value and amount of loss claimed; and within sixty days after the 
loss, unless such time is extended in writing by the Company, the insured shall 
render to this Company a proof of loss, signed and sworn to by the insured, 
stating the knowledge and belief of the insured as to the following: the time 
and origin of the loss, the interest of the insured and of all others in the 
property, the actual cash value of each item thereof and the amount of loss 
thereto, all encumbrances thereon, all other contracts of insurance, whether 
valid or not, covering any of said property, any changes in the title, use, 
occupation, location, possession or exposures of said property since the issuing 
of this policy, by whom and for what purpose any building herein described and 
the several parts thereof were occupied at the time of loss and whether or not 
it then stood on leased ground, and shall furnish a copy of all the descriptions 
and schedules in all policies and, if required, verified plans and 
specifications of any building, fixtures or machinery destroyed or damaged. The 
insured, as often as may be reasonably required, shall exhibit to any person 
designated by this Company all that remains of any property herein described, 
and submit to examinations under oath by any person named by this Company, and 
subscribe the same, and as often as may be reasonably required, shall produce 
for examination all books of account, bills, invoices and other vouchers or 
certified copies thereof if originals be lost, at such reasonable time and place 
as may be designated by this Company or its representative, and shall permit 
extracts and copies thereof to be made.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Appraisal. In case the insured and this Company shall 
fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss, then, on the 
written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested 
appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within twenty (20) days 
of such demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested 
umpire; and failing for fifteen (15) days to agree upon such umpire, then, on 
request of the insured or this Company, after notice of hearing to the 
nonrequesting party by certified mail, such umpire shall be selected by a judge 
of a district court in the county where the loss occurred. The appraisers shall 
then appraise the loss, stating separately actual cash value and loss to each 
item, and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences, only, to the 
umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed with this 
Company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss. Each appraiser 
shall be paid by the party selecting him and the expenses of appraisal and 
umpire shall be paid by the parties equally.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Company's option. It shall be optional with this 
Company to take all, or any part, of the property at the agreed or appraised 
value, and also to repair, rebuild or replace the property destroyed or damaged 
with other of like kind and quality within a reasonable time, on giving notice 
of its intention so to do within thirty days after the receipt of the proof of 
loss herein required.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Abandonment. There can be no abandonment to this 
Company of any property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>When loss payable. The amount of loss for which this 
Company may be liable shall be payable sixty days after proof of loss, as herein 
provided, is received by this Company and ascertainment of the loss is made 
either by agreement between the insured and this Company expressed in writing or 
by the filing with this Company of an award as herein provided.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Suit. No suit or action on this policy for the 
recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless 
all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with, and unless 
commenced within twelve months next after inception of the loss.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Subrogation. This Company may require from the 
insured an assignment of all right of recovery against any party for loss to the 
extent that payment therefor is made by this Company.</FONT></P>
