<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>A. 1. Any individual of competent legal capacity may procure or effect an 
insurance contract upon his or her own life or body for the benefit of any 
person. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, no person shall 
procure or cause to be procured any insurance contract upon the life or body of 
another individual unless the benefits under the contract are payable to the 
individual insured or a personal representatives, or to a person having, at the 
time when the contract was made, an insurable interest in the individual 
insured.</P>
<P>2. In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a policy procured and 
owned by a corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company, or 
other legal entity on the life or body of an officer, director, manager, member, 
or employee, other than a sole proprietor, upon the termination of the insurable 
interest, the owner of the policy shall, if permitted by the terms of the 
policy, offer to sell, transfer, or assign the policy to the insured in exchange 
for the cash surrender value of the policy or, if there is no cash value, in 
exchange for an amount equal to the total of any premiums paid for the policy, 
minus any dividends received, plus interest. This offer shall be made in writing 
to the insured after termination of the insurable interest. The offer shall 
state the time for acceptance which shall not be less than thirty (30) days 
after receipt of the offer by the insured. If the insured rejects the offer or 
fails to accept the offer in the time provided, the owner of the policy may 
continue to own the policy subject to its terms.</P>
<P>B. If the beneficiary, assignee, or other payee under any contract made in 
violation of this section receives from the insurer any benefits thereunder 
accruing upon the death, disability, or injury of the individual insured, the 
individual insured or an executor or administrator, as the case may be, may 
maintain an action to recover such benefits from the person receiving them.</P>
<P>C. "Insurable interest" with reference to personal insurance includes only 
interests as follows:</P>
<P>1. In the case of individuals related closely by blood or by law, a 
substantial interest engendered by love and affection;</P>
<P>2. In the case of other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest 
in having the life, health, or bodily safety of the individual insured continue, 
as distinguished from an interest which would arise only by, or would be 
enhanced in value by, the death, disability, or injury of the individual 
insured;</P>
<P>3. An individual heretofore or hereafter party to a contract or option for 
the purchase or sale of an interest in a business partnership or firm, or of 
shares of stock of a closed corporation or of an interest in such shares, has an 
insurable interest in the life of each individual party to the contract and for 
the purposes of the contract only, in addition to any insurable interest which 
may otherwise exist as to the life of the individual;</P>
<P>4. A trustee of a trust, whenever established, shall be deemed to have an 
insurable interest in:</P>
<P>a. the individual insured who established the trust,</P>
<P>b. each individual in whose life the owner of the trust for federal income 
tax purposes has an insurable interest, and</P>
<P>c. each individual in whose life a beneficiary of the trust has an insurable 
interest; and the proceeds of the life insurance policy are primarily for the 
benefit of the trust beneficiaries having an insurable interest in the life of 
the individual insured; and</P>
<P>5. a. An employer, or a trust which is sponsored by an employer for the 
benefit of its employees, shall have an insurable interest in each of the lives 
of the employees, directors, or retired employees of the employer. 
Notwithstanding paragraph 2 of subsection C of this section or Section 4101 of 
this title, and amendments thereto, the employer or trust may insure the life of 
any employee, director, or retired employee for the benefit of the employer or 
trust on an individual or group basis only with the written consent of the 
insured.</P>
<P>b. The consent requirement of Section 3607 of this title shall be 
accomplished as follows:</P>
<P>(1) the employer shall notify the employee, director, or retired employee by 
a written notice that the employer or trust would like to obtain life insurance 
coverage with respect to the person's life, and</P>
<P>(2) if the employee, director, or retired employee fails to provide written 
consent to the employer or trust, the employer or trust shall not purchase or 
obtain such insurance.</P>
<P>c. It shall be unlawful for the employer or trust to retaliate against any 
person for refusing to consent to the issuance of insurance on the person.</P>
<P>d. The insurable interest of the employer or trust in nonmanagement and 
retired employees shall be limited to an amount agreed to by the employee or, in 
the absence of an agreement, an amount of aggregate projected death benefits 
commensurate with the aggregate projected liabilities to the employee under all 
employee welfare benefit plans, as defined in Section 1002(1) of Title 29 of the 
United States Code. Calculations of life insurance benefits and welfare benefit 
liabilities shall be made in accordance with generally accepted actuarial 
principles. Matching of life insurance benefits and welfare benefit liabilities 
may be done on cash flow, present value, or other appropriate basis.</P>
<P>e. For purposes of this section:</P>
<P>(1) "employer" means any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, 
limited liability company, corporation, or other legal entity that is legally 
doing business in this state; the term shall also include all entities or 
persons which are controlled by or affiliated with any of the foregoing. The 
determination of whether any entity or person is controlled by or affiliated 
with another shall be made by applying the principles set forth in subsection 
(b) or (c) of Section 414 of Title 26 of the United States Code, as in effect on 
January 1, 1993, except that all references therein to eighty percent (80%) 
shall be changed to fifty-one percent (51%), and</P>
<P>(2) "employee" means any common law employee of an employer.</P>
<P>f. This section shall not be interpreted to limit other insurable interests 
which may exist by statute or at common law.</P>
<P>g. Determination of the existence and extent of the insurable interest under 
any life insurance policy shall be made at the time the contract of insurance 
becomes effective, provided however, the insurable interest need not exist at 
the time the loss occurs.</P>
<P>D. Life insurance contracts may be entered into in which the person paying 
the consideration for the insurance has no insurable interest in the life of the 
individual insured, where charitable, benevolent, educational or religious 
institutions, or their agencies, are designated as the beneficiaries thereof. In 
no event shall an individual be named as a beneficiary. In making these 
contracts, the person paying the premium shall make and sign the application 
therefor as owner and shall designate a charitable, benevolent, educational, or 
religious institution, or an agency thereof, as the beneficiary or beneficiaries 
of the contract. The application or any subsequent change of beneficiary 
designation shall be signed by the individual whose life is to be insured. These 
contracts shall be valid and binding among the parties, notwithstanding the 
absence otherwise of an insurable interest in the life of the individual 
insured.</P>
<P>E. Life insurance contracts may be entered into in which the members of an 
alumni association of an institution of higher education accredited by the 
Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education are insured under a group insurance 
policy and either the institution is the designated beneficiary thereof or the 
association is the designated beneficiary with the stipulation that the 
association will use the proceeds of the policies for direct grants to the 
institution or for scholarships for students of such institutions. In no event 
shall an individual be named as a beneficiary to such a policy. In making such 
contracts, the person paying the premium shall make and sign the application 
therefor as owner and shall designate an institution or alumni association as 
the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such contract. The application or any 
subsequent change of beneficiary designation shall be signed also by the 
individual whose life is to be insured. These contracts shall be valid and 
binding among the parties thereto, notwithstanding the absence of an insurable 
interest in the life of the individual insured.</P>
