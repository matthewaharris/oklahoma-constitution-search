in the best interest of the viator. The term does not include an attorney, 
certified public accountant or a financial planner accredited by a nationally 
recognized accreditation agency, who is retained to represent the viator and 
whose compensation is not paid directly or indirectly by the viatical settlement 
provider or purchaser;</P><STRIKE>
<P></STRIKE>16. "Viatical settlement contract" means a written agreement between

Viatical settlement contract also means the transfer for compensation or value 
of ownership or beneficial interest in a trust or other entity that owns such

<P>(b) the costs of the loan, including, without limitation, interest, 
arrangement fees, utilization fees and similar fees, closing costs, legal fees 
and expenses, trustee fees and expenses, and third-party collateral provider 
fees and expenses, including fees payable to letter of credit issuers,</P>
<P>(3) a loan made by a bank or other licensed financial institution in which 
the lender takes an interest in a life insurance policy solely to secure

the default on the loan nor the transfer of the policy in connection with the 
default is pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any other person for 
the purpose of evading regulation under this act,</P>
<P>(4) a loan made by a lender that does not violate Sections 4-101 through 
4-304 of Title 14A of the Oklahoma Statutes, provided that the premium finance 
loan is not described in this subparagraph,</P>
<P>(5) an agreement where all the parties:</P>
<P>(a) are closely related to the insured by blood or law, or</P>
<P>(b) have a lawful substantial economic interest in the continued life, health 
and bodily safety of the person insured, or are trusts established primarily for 
the benefit of such parties,</P>
<P>(6) any designation, consent or agreement by an insured who is an employee of

limited liability company and one or more of its members or one or more trusts 
established by its members,</P>
<P>(8) an agreement entered into by a service recipient, or a trust established 
by the service recipient, and a service provider, or a trust established by the 
service provider, who performs significant services for the service recipients 
trade or business, or</P>
<P>(9) any other contract, transaction or arrangement exempted from the

<P></STRIKE>17. "Viatical settlement provider" means a person, other than a

sum of money as consideration for a life insurance policy or an interest in the 
death benefits of a life insurance policy, or a person who owns or acquires or
