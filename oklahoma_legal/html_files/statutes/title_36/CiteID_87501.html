<P><STRONG><EM>Multiple Amendments Enacted During the 2013 Legislative 
Session</EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Version 1 (as amended by Laws 2013, HB 2191, c. 103, § 1, eff. 
November 1, 2013)</STRONG></P>
<P>A. Premium rates for health benefit plans subject to the Small Employer 
Health Insurance Reform Act shall be subject to the following provisions:</P>
<P>1. The rate manual developed for use by a small employer carrier shall be 
filed and approved by the Insurance Commissioner prior to use. Any changes to 
the rate manual shall be filed and approved by the Insurance Commissioner prior 
to use. Every filing shall be made not less than thirty (30) days prior to the 
date the small employer carrier intends to implement the rates. The rate manual 
so filed shall be deemed approved upon expiration of the thirty-day waiting 
period unless, prior to the end of the period, it has been affirmatively 
approved or disapproved by order of the Commissioner. Approval of a rate manual 
by the Commissioner shall constitute a waiver of any unexpired portion of the 
thirty-day waiting period. The Commissioner may extend the period to approve or 
disapprove a rate manual by not more than an additional thirty (30) days by 
giving notice of such extension before expiration of the initial thirty-day 
period. At the expiration of an extended period, the rate filing shall be deemed 
approved unless otherwise approved or disapproved by the Commissioner. The 
Commissioner may at any time, after notice and for cause shown, withdraw 
approval of a filed rate;</P>
<P>2. A small employer health benefit plan shall not be delivered or issued for 
delivery unless the policy form or certificate form can be expected to return to 
policyholders and certificate holders in the form of aggregate benefits provided 
under the policy form or certificate form at least sixty percent (60%) of the 
aggregate amount of premiums earned. The rate of return shall be estimated for 
the entire period for which rates are computed to provide coverage. The rate of 
return shall be calculated on the basis of incurred claims experience or 
incurred health care expenses where coverage is provided by a health maintenance 
organization on a service rather than reimbursement basis and earned premiums 
for the period in accordance with accepted actuarial principles and 
practices;</P>
<P>3. The index rate for a rating period for any class of business shall not 
exceed the index rate for any other class of business by more than twenty 
percent (20%);</P>
<P>4. For a class of business, the premium rates charged during a rating period 
to small employers with similar case characteristics for the same or similar 
coverage, or the rates that could be charged to such employers under the rating 
system for that class of business, shall not vary from the index rate by more 
than twenty-five percent (25%) of the index rate;</P>
<P>5. The percentage increase in the premium rate charged to a small employer 
for a new rating period may not exceed the sum of the following:</P>
<P>a. the percentage change in the new business premium rate measured from the 
first day of the prior rating period to the first day of the new rating period. 
In the case of a health benefit plan into which the small employer carrier is no 
longer enrolling new small employers, the small employer carrier shall use the 
percentage change in the base premium rate, provided that the change does not 
exceed, on a percentage basis, the change in the new business premium rate for 
the most similar health benefit plan into which the small employer carrier is 
actively enrolling new small employers,</P>
<P>b. any adjustment, not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) annually and adjusted 
pro rata for rating periods of less than one year, due to the claim experience, 
health status or duration of coverage of the employees or dependents of the 
small employer as determined from the rate manual for the class of business of 
the small employer carrier, and</P>
<P>c. any adjustment due to change in coverage or change in the case 
characteristics of the small employer, as determined from the rate manual for 
the class of business of the small employer carrier;</P>
<P>6. Adjustments in rates for claim experience, health status and duration of 
coverage shall not be charged to individual employees or dependents. Any 
adjustment shall be applied uniformly to the rates charged for all employees and 
dependents of the small employer;</P>
<P>7. A small employer carrier may utilize industry as a case characteristic in 
establishing premium rates; provided, the highest rate factor associated with 
any industry classification shall not exceed the lowest rate factor associated 
with any industry classification by more than fifteen percent (15%);</P>
<P>8. In the case of health benefit plans issued prior to the effective date of 
the Small Employer Health Insurance Reform Act, a premium rate for a rating 
period may exceed the ranges set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this subsection 
for a period of three (3) years following the effective date of the Small 
Employer Health Insurance Reform Act. In such case, the percentage increase in 
the premium rate charged to a small employer for a new rating period shall not 
exceed the sum of the following:</P>
<P>a. the percentage change in the new business premium rate measured from the 
first day of the prior rating period to the first day of the new rating period. 
In the case of a health benefit plan into which the small employer carrier is no 
longer enrolling new small employers, the small employer carrier shall use the 
percentage change in the base premium rate, provided that the change does not 
exceed, on a percentage basis, the change in the new business premium rate for 
the most similar health benefit plan into which the small employer carrier is 
actively enrolling new small employers, and</P>
<P>b. any adjustment due to change in coverage or change in the case 
characteristics of the small employer, as determined from the rate manual of the 
carrier for the class of business;</P>
<P>9. Small employer carriers shall:</P>
<P>a. apply rating factors, including case characteristics, consistently with 
respect to all small employers in a class of business. Rating factors shall 
produce premiums for identical groups within the same class of business which 
differ only by amounts attributable to plan design and do not reflect 
differences due to claims experience, health status and duration of coverage, 
and</P>
<P>b. treat all health benefit plans issued or renewed in the same calendar 
month as having the same rating period;</P>
<P>10. For the purposes of this subsection, a health benefit plan that utilizes 
a restricted provider network shall not be considered similar coverage to a 
health benefit plan that does not utilize such a network, provided that 
utilization of the restricted provider network results in substantial 
differences in claims costs;</P>
<P>11. The Insurance Commissioner may establish rules to implement the 
provisions of this section and to assure that rating practices used by small 
employer carriers are consistent with the purposes of the Small Employer Health 
Insurance Reform Act, including:</P>
<P>a. assuring that differences in rates charged for health benefit plans by 
small employer carriers are reasonable and reflect objective differences in plan 
design, not including differences due to claims experience, health status or 
duration of coverage, and</P>
<P>b. prescribing the manner in which case characteristics may be used by small 
employer carriers.</P>
<P>B. A small employer carrier shall not transfer a small employer involuntarily 
into or out of a class of business. A small employer carrier shall not offer to 
transfer a small employer into or out of a class of business unless the offer is 
made to transfer all small employers in the class of business without regard to 
case characteristics, claim experience, health status or duration of 
coverage.</P>
<P>C. The Commissioner may suspend for a specified period the application of 
paragraph 3 of subsection A of this section as to the premium rates applicable 
to one or more small employers included within a class of business of a small 
employer carrier for one or more rating periods upon a filing by the small 
employer carrier and a finding by the Commissioner either that the suspension is 
reasonably necessary in light of the financial condition of the small employer 
carrier or that the suspension would enhance the efficiency and fairness of the 
marketplace for small employer health insurance.</P>
<P>D. Nothing in the Small Employer Health Insurance Reform Act shall prohibit a 
small employer carrier from including in premium rate development an employer's 
bona fide wellness program for its employees including, but not limited to, a 
tobacco cessation program.</P>
<P><STRONG>Version 2 (as amended by Laws 2013, HB 1512, c. 269, § 15, eff.
