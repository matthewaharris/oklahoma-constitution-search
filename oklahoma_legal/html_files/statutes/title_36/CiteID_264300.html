Department as a licensed insurance company, licensed HMO, licensed group health 
service organization or motor service club.</P>
<P>2. To register as a discount medical plan organization, an applicant

<P>a. file with the Insurance Department an application on the form that the 
Insurance Commissioner requires, and</P>
<P>b. pay to the Insurance Department an application fee of Two Hundred Fifty

the Insurance Commissioner requires, and</P>
<P>c. pays to the Insurance Department a renewal fee of Two Hundred Fifty 
Dollars ($250.00).</P>
<P>6. The Insurance Commissioner may deny a registration to an applicant or

affairs of any discount medical plan organization. The Insurance Department may 
require any discount medical plan organization or applicant to produce any 
records, books, files, advertising and solicitation materials, or other 
information and may take statements under oath to determine whether the discount 
medical plan organization or applicant is in violation of the law or is acting 
contrary to the public interest. The expenses incurred in conducting any 
examination or investigation shall be paid by the discount medical plan 
organization or applicant. Examinations and investigations shall be conducted as 
provided in Sections 309.1 and 309.3 through 309.7 of this title. Discount 
medical plan organizations shall be governed by the provisions of this section 
and shall not be subject to the provisions of the Insurance Code unless 
specifically referenced.</P>
<P>2. All work papers, recorded information, documents, books, files, 
advertising and solicitation materials, copies or other information produced by,

course of analysis by the Commissioner or other person, shall be given 
confidential treatment by the Commissioner and may not be made public by the 
Commissioner or any other person who obtained the information in the course of 
the examination or investigation, except to the extent provided in this section. 
Access may be granted to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. 
The parties shall agree in writing prior to receiving the information to provide 
to it the same confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the 
prior written consent of the company to which it pertains has been obtained. The 
confidentiality and protection from discovery by subpoena provided for in this 
paragraph shall not be construed to be extended to identical, similar or other 
related documents or information or to the work papers that are not deemed to be 
in the possession, custody or control of the Commissioner.</P>
<P>3. Failure by the discount medical plan organization to pay the expenses 
incurred under paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be grounds for denial or 
revocation of the discount medical plan organizations registration.</P>
<P>D. 1. A discount medical plan organization may charge a reasonable one-time 
processing fee and a periodic charge.</P>
<P>2. If the member cancels the membership within the first thirty (30) days

cards the terms "insurance", "health plan", "coverage", "copay", "copayments",

<P>c. pay providers any fees for medical services.</P>

<P>b. that the plan provides discounts with certain health care providers for 
medical services,</P>
<P>c. that the plan does not make payments directly to the providers of medical 
services,</P>

medical plan provided to the prospective or new member.</P>
<P>3. The discount card provided to members shall prominently display the words 
"This is not insurance".</P>
<P>G. 1. All providers offering medical services to members under a discount 
medical plan shall provide such services pursuant to a written agreement. The 
agreement may be entered into directly by the health care provider or by a 
health care provider network to which the provider belongs if the provider 
network has contracts with the health care provider that allow the provider 
network to contract on behalf of the health care provider.</P>
<P>2. A health care provider agreement shall provide the following:</P>
<P>a. a description of the services and products to be provided at a 
discount,</P>
<P>b. the amount or amounts of the discounts or, alternatively, a fee schedule 
which reflects the health care provider's discounted rates, and</P>
<P>c. a provision that the health care provider will not charge members more 
than the discounted rates.</P>
<P>3. A health care provider agreement with a health care provider network shall 
require that the health care provider network have written agreements with its 
health care providers that:</P>
<P>a. contain the terms described in paragraph 2 of this subsection,</P>
<P>b. authorize the health care provider network to contract with the discount 
medical plan organization on behalf of the provider, and</P>
<P>c. require the network to maintain an up-to-date list of its contracted 
health care providers and to provide that list on a quarterly basis to the 
discount medical plan organization.</P>
<P>4. The discount medical plan organization shall maintain a copy of each 
active health care provider agreement into which it has entered.</P>
<P>H. 1. There shall be a written agreement between the discount medical plan 
organization and the member specifying the benefits under the discount medical 
plan and complying with the disclosure requirements of this section.</P>
<P>2. All forms used, including the written agreement pursuant to the provisions 
of subsection G of this section, shall first be filed with the Insurance 
Department. Every form filed shall be identified by a unique form number placed

($25.00) per form shall be payable to the Insurance Department for deposit into 
the General Revenue Fund.</P>
<P>I. 1. Each discount medical plan organization required to be registered 
pursuant to this section except an affiliate shall, at all times, maintain a net 
worth of at least One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00).</P>
<P>2. The Insurance Department may not allow a registration unless the discount 
medical plan organization has a net worth of at least One Hundred Fifty Thousand 
Dollars ($150,000.00).</P>
<P>J. 1. The Insurance Department may suspend the authority of a discount 
medical plan organization to enroll new members, revoke any registration issued 
to a discount medical plan organization, or order compliance if the Department 
finds that any of the following conditions exist:</P>
<P>a. the organization is not operating in compliance with the provisions of 
this section,</P>
<P>b. the organization does not have the minimum net worth as required by this 
section,</P>
<P>c. the organization has advertised, merchandised or attempted to merchandise 
its services in such a manner as to misrepresent its services or capacity for 
service or has engaged in deceptive, misleading or unfair practices with respect 
to advertising or merchandising,</P>
<P>d. the organization is not fulfilling its obligations as a discount medical 
plan organization, or</P>
<P>e. the continued operation of the organization would be hazardous to its 
members.</P>
<P>2. If the Insurance Department has cause to believe that grounds for the 
suspension or revocation of a registration exist, the Insurance Department shall 
notify the discount medical plan organization in writing, specifically stating 
the grounds for suspension or revocation, and shall provide opportunity for a 
hearing on the matter in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act and 
the Oklahoma Insurance Code.</P>
<P>3. When the certificate of registration of a discount medical plan 
organization is nonrenewed, surrendered or revoked, such organization shall 
proceed, immediately following the effective date of the order of revocation, or 
in the case of nonrenewal, the date of expiration of the certificate of 
registration, to wind up its affairs transacted under the certificate of 
registration. The organization may not engage in any further advertising, 
solicitation, collecting of fees, or renewal of contracts.</P>
<P>4. The Insurance Department shall, in its order suspending the authority of a 
discount medical plan organization to enroll new members, specify the period 
during which the suspension is to be in effect and the conditions, if any, which 
shall be met by the discount medical plan organization prior to reinstatement of 
its registration to enroll new members. The order of suspension is subject to 
rescission or modification by further order of the Insurance Department prior to 
the expiration of the suspension period. Reinstatement may not be made unless 
requested by the discount medical plan organization; however, the Insurance 
Department may not grant reinstatement if it finds that the circumstances for 
which the suspension occurred still exist or are likely to reoccur.</P>
<P>K. Each discount medical plan organization required to be registered pursuant 
to this section shall provide the Insurance Department at least thirty (30) 
days' advance notice of any change in the discount medical plan organization's 
name, address, principal business address, or mailing address.</P>
<P>L. Each discount medical plan organization shall maintain an up-to-date list 
of the names and addresses of the providers with which it has contracted on an 
Internet web site page, the address of which shall be prominently displayed on 
all its advertisements, marketing materials, brochures, and discount cards. This 
section applies to those providers with whom the discount medical plan 
organization has contracted directly, as well as those who are members of a 
provider network with which the discount medical plan organization has 
contracted.</P>
<P>M. 1. All advertisements, marketing materials, brochures and discount cards 
used by marketers shall be approved in writing for such use by the discount 
medical plan organization.</P>
<P>2. The discount medical plan organization shall have an executed written 
agreement with a marketer prior to the marketer's marketing, promoting, selling, 
or distributing the discount medical plan.</P>
<P>N. The Insurance Commissioner may promulgate rules to administer the 
provisions of this section.</P>
<P>O. Regulation of discount medical plan organizations shall be done pursuant 
to the Administrative Procedures Act.</P>
<P>P. 1. A discount medical plan organization required to be registered pursuant 
to this section except an affiliate shall maintain a surety bond with the 
Insurance Department, having at all times a value of not less than Thirty-five 
Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00), for use by the Insurance Department in protecting 
plan members.</P>
<P>2. No judgment creditor or other claimant of a discount medical plan 
organization, other than the Insurance Department, shall have the right to levy 
upon the surety bond held pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this 
subsection.</P>
<P>Q. 1. A person who knowingly and willfully operates as or aids and abets 
another operating as a discount medical plan organization in violation of 
subsection B of this section commits a felony, punishable as provided for in 
Oklahoma law, as if the discount medical plan organization were an unauthorized 
insurer, and the fees, dues, charges, or other consideration collected from the
