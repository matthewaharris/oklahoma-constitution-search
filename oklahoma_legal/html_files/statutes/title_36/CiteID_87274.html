<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. No long-term care insurance policy 
shall:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Be canceled, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated 
on the grounds of age or the deterioration of the mental or physical health of 
the insured individual or certificate holder;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Contain a provision establishing a new waiting 
period in the event existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new or 
other form within the same company, except with respect to an increase in 
benefits voluntarily selected by the insured individual or group policyholder; 
or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Provide coverage for skilled nursing care only or 
provide significantly more coverage for skilled care in a facility than coverage 
for lower levels of care.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. 1. No long-term care insurance policy or 
certificate shall use a definition of "preexisting condition" which is more 
restrictive than the following: Preexisting condition means a condition for 
which medical advice or treatment was recommended by, or received from a 
provider of health care services, within six (6) months preceding the effective 
date of coverage of an insured person.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. No long-term care insurance policy or certificate 
shall exclude coverage for a loss or confinement which is the result of a 
preexisting condition unless such loss or confinement begins within six (6) 
months following the effective date of coverage of an insured person.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The definition of "preexisting condition" does not 
prohibit an insurer:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. from using an application form designed to elicit 
the complete health history of an applicant, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. from underwriting, on the basis of the answers on 
that application, in accordance with that insurer's established underwriting 
standards.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Unless otherwise provided in the policy or 
certificate, a preexisting condition, regardless of whether it is disclosed on 
the application, need not be covered until the waiting period described in 
paragraph 2 of subsection B of this section expires. No long-term care insurance 
policy or certificate may exclude or use waivers or riders of any kind to 
exclude, limit or reduce coverage or benefits for specifically named or 
described preexisting diseases or physical conditions beyond the waiting period 
described in paragraph 2 of subsection B of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Prior 
hospitalization/institutionalization:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. No long-term care insurance policy may be 
delivered or issued in this state if such policy:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. conditions eligibility for any benefits on a prior 
hospitalization requirement,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. conditions eligibility for benefits provided in an 
institutional care setting on the receipt of a higher level of institutional 
care, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. conditions eligibility for any benefits other than 
waiver of premium, post-confinement, post-acute care or recuperative benefits on 
a prior institutionalization requirement.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. a. A long-term care insurance policy containing 
post-confinement, post-acute care or recuperative benefits shall clearly label 
in a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate entitled "Limitations or 
Conditions on Eligibility for Benefits" such limitations or conditions, 
including any required number of days of confinement.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. A long-term care insurance policy or rider which 
conditions eligibility of noninstitutional benefits on the prior receipt of 
institutional care shall not require a prior institutional stay of more than 
thirty(30) days.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. No law, rule or regulation shall establish loss 
ratio standards for long-term care insurance policies unless a specific 
reference to long-term care insurance policies is contained in such law, rule or 
regulation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. Long-term care insurance applicants shall have the 
right to return the policy or certificate within thirty (30) days after its 
delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or 
certificate, the applicant is not satisfied with the policy, for any reason. 
Long-term care insurance policies and certificates shall have a notice 
prominently printed on the first page of the policy or attached thereto, stating 
in substance, that the applicant shall have the right to return the policy or 
certificate within thirty (30) days after its delivery and to have the premium 
refunded if, after examination of the policy, or certificate, the applicant is 
not satisfied with the policy, for any reason. If an application for a qualified 
long-term care contract is denied, the insurer shall refund to the applicant any 
premium and any other fees submitted by the applicant within thirty (30) days of 
the date of the denial. If the insurer does not return any premiums or moneys 
paid therefor within thirty (30) days from the date of cancellation, the insurer 
shall pay interest on the proceeds which shall be the same rate of interest as 
the average United States Treasury Bill rate of the preceding calendar year, as 
certified to the Insurance Commissioner by the State Treasurer on the first 
regular business day in January of each year, plus two (2) percentage points, 
which shall accrue from the date of cancellation until the premiums or moneys 
are returned. In such event, the long-term care policy shall be deemed to have 
been canceled on the date the policy was placed in the United States mail in a 
properly addressed, postpaid envelope, or, if not so posted, on the date of 
delivery of such policy or annuity to the insurer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. An outline of coverage shall be delivered to a 
prospective applicant for long-term care insurance at the time of initial 
solicitation through means which prominently direct the attention of the 
recipient to the document and its purpose. The Insurance Commissioner shall 
prescribe a standard format, including style, arrangement and overall 
appearance, and the content of an outline of coverage. In the case of agent 
solicitations, an agent must deliver the outline of coverage prior to the 
presentation of an application or enrollment form. In the case of direct 
response solicitations, the outline of coverage must be presented in conjunction 
with any application or enrollment form. Such outline of coverage shall include, 
but not be limited to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. A description of the principal benefits and 
coverage provided in the policy;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A statement of the principal exclusions, 
reductions and limitations contained in the policy;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. A statement of the terms under which the policy or 
certificate, or both, may be continued in force or discontinued, including any 
reservation in the policy of a right to change premiums. Continuation or 
conversion provisions of group coverage shall be specifically 
described;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. A statement that the outline of coverage is a 
summary only, not a contract of insurance, and that the policy or group master 
policy contains governing contractual provisions;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. A description of the terms under which the policy 
or certificate may be returned and premium refunded;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. A brief description of the relationship of cost of 
care and benefits; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. If the policy or certificate is intended to be a 
qualified long-term care insurance contract, a statement that discloses to the 
policyholder or certificate holder that the policy is intended to be a qualified 
long-term care insurance contract.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. The insurer of a qualified long-term care 
insurance contract shall deliver to the applicant, policyholder, or certificate 
holder the contract or certificate no later than thirty (30) days after the date 
of approval.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. At the time of policy delivery, a policy summary 
shall be delivered for an individual life insurance policy which provides 
long-term care benefits within the policy or by rider. In the case of direct 
response solicitations, the insurer shall deliver the policy summary upon the 
applicant's request, but regardless of request shall make such delivery no later 
than at the time of policy delivery. In addition to complying with all 
applicable requirements, the summary shall also include:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. An explanation of how the long-term care benefit 
interacts with other components of the policy, including deductions from death 
benefits;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. An illustration of the amount of benefits, the 
length of benefit, and the guaranteed lifetime benefits if any, for each covered 
person;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Any exclusions, reductions and limitations on 
benefits of long-term care; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If applicable to the policy type, the summary 
shall also include:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. a disclosure of the effects of exercising other 
rights under the policy,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. a disclosure of guarantees related to long-term 
care costs of insurance charges, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. current and projected maximum lifetime 
benefit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. Any time a long-term care benefit, funded through 
a life insurance vehicle by the acceleration of the death benefit, is in benefit 
payment status, a monthly report shall be provided to the policyholder. Such 
report shall include:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Any long-term care benefits paid out during the 
month;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. An explanation of any changes in the policy, e.g. 
death benefits or cash values, due to long-term care benefits being paid out; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The amount of long-term care benefits existing or 
remaining.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. If a claim under a qualified long-term care 
insurance contract is denied, the issuer shall, within sixty (60) days of the 
date of a written request by the policyholder or certificate holder, or a 
representative thereof:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Provide a written explanation of the reasons for the 
denial; and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Make available all information directly related to 
such denial.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. No policy shall be advertised, marketed or offered 
as long-term care insurance unless it complies with the provisions of the 
Long-Term Care Insurance Act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>L. Policies or contracts issued by life care 
communities which are not licensed insurers in this state shall contain the 
following statement in conspicuous bold-face type on the front of the policy or 
contract: "The financial condition of the entity issuing this contract is not 
subject to review by or the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner. 
This contract is not subject to the protection of any guaranty 
association."</FONT></P><B><I>
