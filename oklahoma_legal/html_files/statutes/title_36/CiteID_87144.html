<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p><span>A. No policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued, delivered, renewed, or extended in this state with respect to a motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless the policy includes the coverage described in subsection B of this section.</span></p>

<p><span>B. The policy referred to in subsection A of this section shall provide coverage therein or supplemental thereto for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and hit-and-run motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom. Coverage shall be not less than the amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a policy meeting the requirements of Section 7-204 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes, as the same may be hereafter amended; provided, however, that increased limits of liability shall be offered and purchased if desired, not to exceed the limits provided in the policy of bodily injury liability of the insured. Policies issued, renewed or reinstated after November 1, 2014, shall not be subject to stacking or aggregation of limits unless expressly provided for by an insurance carrier. The uninsured motorist coverage shall be upon a form approved by the Insurance Commissioner as otherwise provided in the Insurance Code and may provide that the parties to the contract shall, upon demand of either, submit their differences to arbitration; provided, that if agreement by arbitration is not reached within three (3) months from date of demand, the insured may sue the tort-feasor.</span></p>

<p><span>C. For the purposes of this coverage the term "uninsured motor vehicle" shall include an insured motor vehicle where the liability insurer thereof is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured within the limits specified therein because of insolvency. For the purposes of this coverage the term "uninsured motor vehicle" shall also include an insured motor vehicle, the liability limits of which are less than the amount of the claim of the person or persons making such claim, regardless of the amount of coverage of either of the parties in relation to each other.</span></p>

<p><span>D. An insurer's insolvency protection shall be applicable only to accidents occurring during a policy period in which its insured's uninsured motorist coverage is in effect where the liability insurer of the tort-feasor becomes insolvent within one (1) year after such an accident. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any insurer from according insolvency protection under terms and conditions more favorable to its insured than is provided hereunder.</span></p>

<p><span>E. For purposes of this section, there is no coverage for any insured while occupying a motor vehicle owned by, or furnished or available for the regular use of the named insured, a resident spouse of the named insured, or a resident relative of the named insured, if such motor vehicle is not insured by a motor vehicle insurance policy.</span></p>

<p><span>F. In the event of payment to any person under the coverage required by this section and subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage, the insurer making such payment shall, to the extent thereof, be entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any rights of recovery of such person against any person or organization legally responsible for the bodily injury for which such payment is made, including the proceeds recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer. Provided, however, with respect to payments made by reason of the coverage described in subsection C of this section, the insurer making such payment shall not be entitled to any right of recovery against such tort-feasor in excess of the proceeds recovered from the assets of the insolvent insurer of said tort-feasor. Provided further, that any payment made by the insured tort-feasor shall not reduce or be a credit against the total liability limits as provided in the insured's own uninsured motorist coverage. Provided further, that if a tentative agreement to settle for liability limits has been reached with an insured tort-feasor, written notice shall be given by certified mail to the uninsured motorist coverage insurer by its insured. Such written notice shall include:</span></p>

<p><span>1. Written documentation of pecuniary losses incurred, including copies of all medical bills; and</span></p>

<p><span>2. Written authorization or a court order to obtain reports from all employers and medical providers. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of this written notice, the uninsured motorist coverage insurer may substitute its payment to the insured for the tentative settlement amount. The uninsured motorist coverage insurer shall then be entitled to the insured's right of recovery to the extent of such payment and any settlement under the uninsured motorist coverage. If the uninsured motorist coverage insurer fails to pay the insured the amount of the tentative tort settlement within sixty (60) days, the uninsured motorist coverage insurer has no right to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment, as provided herein, for any amount paid under the uninsured motorist coverage.</span></p>

<p><span>G. A named insured or applicant shall have the right to reject uninsured motorist coverage in writing. The form signed by the insured or applicant which initially rejects coverage or selects lower limits shall remain valid for the life of the policy and the completion of a new selection form shall not be required when a renewal, reinstatement, substitute, replacement, or amended policy is issued to the same-named insured by the same insurer or any of its affiliates. Any changes to an existing policy, regardless of whether these changes create new coverage, do not create a new policy and do not require the completion of a new form.</span></p>

<p><span>After selection of limits, rejection, or exercise of the option not to purchase uninsured motorist coverage by a named insured or applicant for insurance, the insurer shall not be required to notify any insured in any renewal, reinstatement, substitute, amended or replacement policy as to the availability of such uninsured motorist coverage or such optional limits. Such selection, rejection, or exercise of the option not to purchase uninsured motorist coverage by a named insured or an applicant shall be valid for all insureds under the policy and shall continue until a named insured requests in writing that the uninsured motorist coverage be added to an existing or future policy of insurance.</span></p>

<p><span>H. The following are effective on forms required on or after April 1, 2005. The offer of the coverage required by subsection B of this section shall be in the following form which shall be filed with and approved by the Insurance Commissioner. The form shall be provided to the proposed insured in writing separately from the application and shall read substantially as follows:</span></p>

<p align="center"><span>OKLAHOMA UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE LAW</span></p>

<p><span>Oklahoma law gives you the right to buy Uninsured Motorist coverage in the same amount as your bodily injury liability coverage. THE LAW REQUIRES US TO ADVISE YOU OF THIS VALUABLE RIGHT FOR THE PROTECTION OF YOU, MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY, AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE HURT WHILE RIDING IN YOUR INSURED VEHICLE. YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER BUYING THIS COVERAGE IN THE SAME AMOUNT AS YOUR LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE LIMIT.</span></p>

<p><span>Uninsured Motorist coverage, unless otherwise provided in your policy, pays for bodily injury damages to you, members of your family who live with you, and other people riding in your car who are injured by: (1) an uninsured motorist, (2) a hit-and-run motorist, or (3) an insured motorist who does not have enough liability insurance to pay for bodily injury damages to any insured person. Uninsured Motorist coverage, unless otherwise provided in your policy, protects you and family members who live with you while riding in any vehicle or while a pedestrian. THE COST OF THIS COVERAGE IS SMALL COMPARED WITH THE BENEFITS!</span></p>

<p><span>You may make one of four choices about Uninsured Motorist Coverage by indicating below what Uninsured Motorist coverage you want:</span></p>

<p><span>____ I want the same amount of Uninsured Motorist coverage as my bodily injury liability coverage.</span></p>

<p><span>____ I want minimum Uninsured Motorist coverage $25,000.00 per person/$50,000.00 per occurrence.</span></p>

<p><span>____ I want Uninsured Motorist coverage in the following amount:</span></p>

<p><span>$______________ per person/$_________________ per occurrence.</span></p>

<p><span>____ I want to reject Uninsured Motorist coverage.</span></p>

<p><span>_________________________</span></p>

<p align="center"><span>Proposed Insured</span></p>

<p><span>THIS FORM IS NOT A PART OF YOUR POLICY AND DOES NOT PROVIDE COVERAGE.</span></p>

<p><span>I. The Insurance Commissioner shall approve a deviation from the form described in subsection H of this section if the form includes substantially the same information.</span></p>

<p><span>J. A change in the bodily injury liability coverage due to a change in the amount or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death by a policy meeting the requirements of Section 7-204 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall not be considered an amendment of the bodily injury liability coverage and shall not require the completion of a new form.</span></p>

<p><span>K. On the first renewal on or after April 1, 2005, the insurer shall change the Uninsured Motorist coverage limits to $25,000.00 per person/$50,000.00 per occurrence and charge the corresponding premium for existing policyholders who have selected Uninsured Motorist coverage limits less than $25,000.00 per person/$50,000.00 per occurrence. At the first renewal on or after April 1, 2005, the insurer shall provide existing policyholders who have selected Uninsured Motorist coverage limits less than $25,000.00 per person/$50,000.00 per occurrence a notice of the change of their Uninsured Motorist coverage limits and that notice shall state how such policyholders may reject Uninsured Motorist coverage limits or select Uninsured Motorist coverage with limits higher than $25,000.00 per person/$50,000.00 per occurrence. No notice shall be required to existing policyholders who have rejected Uninsured Motorist coverage or have selected Uninsured Motorist coverage limits equal to or greater than $25,000.00 per person/$50,000.00 per occurrence. For purposes of this subsection an existing policyholder is a policyholder who purchased a policy from the insurer before April 1, 2005, and such policy renews on or after April 1, 2005.</span></p>
