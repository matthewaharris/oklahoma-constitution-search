<p>(3) &nbsp;The notice of initial determination under division (1) of this subparagraph shall include a statement informing the covered person and, if applicable, the covered persons authorized representative that a health carriers initial determination that the external review request is ineligible for review may be appealed to the Commissioner.</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;In making a determination under division (1) of this subparagraph, the Commissioners decision shall be made in accordance with the terms of the covered persons health benefit plan and shall be subject to all applicable provisions of the Uniform Health Carrier External Review Act.</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;Upon receipt of the notice that the expedited external review request meets the reviewability requirements of paragraph 2 of subsection B of this section, the Commissioner immediately shall assign an independent review organization to review the expedited request from the list of approved independent review organizations compiled and maintained by the Commissioner pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=463279">Section 6475.12</a> of this title and notify the health carrier of the name of the assigned independent review organization.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;Except for a request for an expedited external review made pursuant to paragraph 2 of subsection A of this section, within one (1) business day after the date of receipt of the request, the Commissioner receives a request for an external review, the Commissioner shall notify the health carrier.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;Within five (5) business days following the date of receipt of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection, the health carrier shall conduct and complete a preliminary review of the request to determine whether:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;the individual is or was a covered person in the health benefit plan at the time the health care service or treatment was recommended or requested or, in the case of a retrospective review, was a covered person in the health benefit plan at the time the health care service or treatment was provided,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;the recommended or requested health care service or treatment that is the subject of the adverse determination or final adverse determination:</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;standard health care services or treatments are not medically appropriate for the covered person, or</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;a. &nbsp;Immediately upon making the decision to reverse its adverse determination or final adverse determination, as provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the health carrier shall notify the covered person, the covered persons authorized representative if applicable, the assigned independent review organization, and the Commissioner in writing of its decision.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;a description of the indicators relevant to determining whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is more likely than not to be beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care services or treatments and the adverse risks of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or treatments,</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;a description and analysis of any medical or scientific evidence, as that term is defined in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=463221">Section 6475.3</a> of this title, considered in reaching the opinion,</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;a description and analysis of any evidence-based standard, as that term is defined in Section 6475.3 of this title, and</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;information on whether the reviewers rationale for the opinion is based on subparagraph a or b of paragraph 5 of subsection I of this section.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;a. &nbsp;For an expedited external review, each clinical reviewer shall provide an opinion orally or in writing to the assigned independent review organization as expeditiously as the covered persons medical condition or circumstances require, but in no event more than five (5) calendar days after being selected in accordance with subsection D of this section.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;medical or scientific evidence or evidence-based standards demonstrate that the expected benefits of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is more likely than not to be beneficial to the covered person than any available standard health care service or treatment and the adverse risks of the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or treatments.</p>

<p>J. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;a. &nbsp;Except as provided in subparagraph b of this paragraph, within twenty (20) days after the date it receives the opinion of each clinical reviewer pursuant to subsection I of this section, the assigned independent review organization, in accordance with paragraph 2 of this subsection, shall make a decision and provide written notice of the decision to:</p>
