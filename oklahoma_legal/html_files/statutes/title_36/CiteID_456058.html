<FONT SIZE=1>Cite as: 36 O.S. § 311A.7 (OSCN 2025), Oklahoma Annual Financial Report Act</FONT><HR>

</div>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The Insurance Commissioner shall not recognize a 
person or firm as a qualified independent certified public accountant if the 
person or firm:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Is not in good standing with the AICPA and in all 
states in which the accountant is licensed to practice, or, for a Canadian or 
British company, that is not a chartered accountant; or</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Has either directly or indirectly entered into an 
agreement of indemnity or release from liability, collectively referred to as 
indemnification, with respect to the audit of the insurer.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Except as otherwise provided in the Oklahoma 
Annual Financial Report Act, the Commissioner shall recognize an independent 
certified public accountant as qualified as long as the accountant conforms to 
the standards of the profession, as contained in the Code of Professional Ethics 
of the AICPA and Rules and Regulations and Code of Ethics and Rules of 
Professional Conduct of the Oklahoma Board of Public Accountancy, or similar 
code.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. A qualified independent certified public 
accountant may enter into an agreement with an insurer to have disputes relating 
to an audit resolved by mediation or arbitration. However, in the event of a 
delinquency proceeding commenced against the insurer under Article 19 of the 
Oklahoma Insurance Code, the mediation or arbitration provisions shall operate 
at the option of the statutory successor.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. 1. The lead or coordinating audit partner having 
primary responsibility for the audit may not act in that capacity for more than 
five (5) consecutive years. The person shall be disqualified from acting in that 
or a similar capacity for the same company or its insurance subsidiaries or 
affiliates for a period of five (5) consecutive years. An insurer may make 
application to the Commissioner for relief from the above rotation requirement 
on the basis of unusual circumstances. This application should be made at least 
thirty (30) days before the end of the calendar year. The Commissioner may 
consider the following factors in determining if the relief should be 
granted:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. number of partners, expertise of the partners, or 
the number of insurance clients in the currently registered firm,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. premium volume of the insurer, or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. number of jurisdictions in which the insurer 
transacts business.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The insurer shall file, with its annual statement 
filing, the approval for relief from paragraph 1 of this subsection with the 
states that it is licensed in or doing business in and with the NAIC. If the 
nondomestic state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall 
file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the NAIC.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The Commissioner shall neither recognize as a 
qualified independent certified public accountant, nor accept an annual audited 
financial report, prepared in whole or in part by, a natural person who:</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Has been convicted of fraud, bribery, a violation 
of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Sections 
1961 to 1968, or any dishonest conduct or practices under federal or state 
law;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Has been found to have violated the insurance laws 
of this state with respect to any previous reports submitted under the Oklahoma 
Annual Financial Report Act; or</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Has demonstrated a pattern or practice of failing 
to detect or disclose material information in previous reports filed under the 
provisions of the Oklahoma Annual Financial Report Act.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. The Commissioner may hold a hearing to determine 
whether an independent certified public accountant is qualified and, considering 
the evidence presented, may rule that the accountant is not qualified for 
purposes of expressing the opinion of the accountant on the financial statements 
in the annual audited financial report made pursuant to the Oklahoma Annual 
Financial Report Act and require the insurer to replace the accountant with 
another whose relationship with the insurer is qualified within the meaning of 
the Oklahoma Annual Financial Report Act.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. 1. The Commissioner shall not recognize as a 
qualified independent certified public accountant, nor accept an annual audited 
financial report, prepared in whole or in part by an accountant who provides to 
an insurer, contemporaneously with the audit, the following non-audit 
services:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. bookkeeping or other services related to the 
accounting records or financial statements of the insurer,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. financial information systems design and 
implementation,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. appraisal or valuation services, fairness 
opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. actuarially oriented advisory services involving 
the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statements. The 
accountant may assist an insurer in understanding the methods, assumptions, and 
inputs used in the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statement 
only if it is reasonable to conclude that the services provided will not be 
subject to audit procedures during an audit of the financial statements of the 
insurer. The actuary of an accountant may also issue an actuarial opinion or 
certification on the reserves of an insurer if the following conditions have 
been met:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) neither the accountant nor the actuary of the 
accountant has performed any management functions or made any management 
decisions,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) the insurer has competent personnel or engages a 
third-party actuary to estimate the reserves for which management takes 
responsibility, and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) the actuary of the accountant tests the 
reasonableness of the reserves after the management of the insurer has 
determined the amount of the reserves,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. internal audit outsourcing services,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. management functions or human resources,</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>g. broker or dealer, investment adviser, or 
investment banking services,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>h. legal services or expert services unrelated to the 
audit, or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>i. any other services that the Commissioner 
determines, by rule, are impermissible.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. In general, the principles of independence with 
respect to services provided by the qualified independent certified public 
accountant are largely predicated on three basic principles, violations of which 
would impair the independence of the accountant. The principles are that the 
accountant cannot function in the role of management, cannot audit the own work 
of the accountant, and cannot serve in an advocacy role for the insurer.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. Insurers having direct written and assumed 
premiums of less than One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000.00) in any 
calendar year may request an exemption from paragraph 1 of subsection G of this 
section. The insurer shall file with the Commissioner a written statement 
discussing the reasons why the insurer should be exempt from these provisions. 
If the Commissioner finds, upon review of the statement, that compliance with 
the Oklahoma Annual Financial Report Act would constitute a financial or 
organizational hardship upon the insurer, an exemption may be granted.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. A qualified independent certified public 
accountant who performs the audit may engage in other non-audit services, 
including tax services, that are not described in paragraph 1 of subsection G of 
this section or that do not conflict with paragraph 2 of subsection G of this 
section, only if the activity is approved in advance by the audit committee, in 
accordance with subsection J of this section.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. All auditing services and non-audit services 
provided to an insurer by the qualified independent certified public accountant 
of the insurer shall be preapproved by the audit committee. The preapproval 
requirement is waived with respect to non-audit services if the insurer is a SOX 
Compliant Entity or a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a SOX 
Compliant entity or:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The aggregate amount of all such non-audit 
services provided to the insurer constitutes not more than five percent (5%) of 
the total amount of fees paid by the insurer to its qualified independent 
certified public accountant during the fiscal year in which the non-audit 
services are provided;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The services were not recognized by the insurer at 
the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The services are promptly brought to the attention 
of the audit committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the 
audit committee or by one or more members of the audit committee who are the 
members of the board of directors to whom authority to grant such approvals has 
been delegated by the audit committee.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. The audit committee may delegate to one or more 
designated members of the audit committee the authority to grant the 
preapprovals required by subsection J of this section. The decisions of any 
member to whom this authority is delegated shall be presented to the full audit 
committee at each of its scheduled meetings.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>L. 1. The Commissioner shall not recognize an 
independent certified public accountant as qualified for a particular insurer if 
a member of the board, president, chief executive officer, controller, chief 
financial officer, chief accounting officer, or any person serving in an 
equivalent position for that insurer, was employed by the independent certified 
public accountant and participated in the audit of that insurer during the 
one-year period preceding the date that the most current statutory opinion is 
due. This subsection shall only apply to partners and senior managers involved 
in the audit. An insurer may make application to the Commissioner for relief 
from the above requirement on the basis of unusual circumstances.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The insurer shall file, with its annual statement 
filing, the approval for relief from paragraph 1 of this subsection with the 
states that it is licensed in or doing business in and the NAIC. If the 
nondomestic state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall 
file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the NAIC.</FONT> </P>
