<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. The priority of distribution of claims from the insurer's estate shall be 
in accordance with the order in which each class of claims is set forth in this 
section. Before the members of the next class receive any payment, every claim 
in each class shall be:</P>
<P>1. Paid in full; or</P>
<P>2. Protected by adequate funds retained for such payment.</P>
<P>Once such funds are approved by the court and paid or retained by the 
liquidator, the insurer's estate shall have no further liability to members of 
that class except to the extent of the retained funds and any other 
undistributed funds. Payment of retained funds pursuant to court order under 
this section extinguishes the potential liability of the receiver to the United 
States or any other governmental entity. No subclasses shall be established 
within any class except as otherwise provided by law. No claim by a shareholder, 
policyholder or other creditor shall be permitted to circumvent the priority 
classes through the use of equitable remedies. The order of distribution of 
claims shall be as provided in subsection B of this section.</P>
<P>B. 1. Class 1. The reasonable costs and expenses of administration expressly 
approved by the receiver, including but not limited to the following:</P>
<P>a. the actual and necessary costs of preserving or recovering the assets of 
the insurer,</P>
<P>b. compensation for all authorized services rendered in the conservation, 
rehabilitation or liquidation,</P>
<P>c. any necessary filing or recordation fees,</P>
<P>d. the fees and mileage payable to witnesses, including experts, and other 
litigation costs and expenses,</P>
<P>e. authorized reasonable attorney fees and other professional services 
rendered in the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation, and</P>
<P>f. any reasonable expenses that were incurred in furtherance of activities 
that provided a material economic benefit to the estate.</P>
<P>2. Class 2. The administrative expenses of guaranty associations. For 
purposes of this section these expenses shall be the reasonable expenses 
incurred by guaranty associations where the expenses are not payments or 
expenses which are required to be incurred as direct policy benefits in 
fulfillment of the terms of the insurance contract or policy, and that are of 
the type and nature that, but for the activities of the guaranty association 
otherwise would have been incurred by the receiver, including but not limited to 
evaluations of policy coverage, activities involved in the adjustment and 
settlement of claims under policies, including those of in-house or outside 
adjusters, and the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the 
arrangements for ongoing coverage through transfer to other insurers, policy 
exchanges or maintaining policies in force. The receiver may in his or her sole 
discretion approve as an administrative expense under this section any other 
reasonable expenses of the guaranty association if the receiver finds:</P>
<P>a. the expenses are not expenses required to be paid or incurred as direct 
policy benefits by the terms of the policy, and</P>
<P>b. the expenses were incurred in furtherance of activities that provided a 
material economic benefit to the estate as a whole, irrespective of whether the 
activities resulted in additional benefits to covered claimants.</P>
<P>The court shall approve such expenses unless it finds the receiver abused his 
or her discretion in approving the expenses. If the receiver determines that any 
administrative expenses of a guaranty association were not reasonable expenses, 
but were nevertheless paid out of a statutory deposit or the proceeds of any 
bond or other asset located in another state or foreign country, then the court 
shall adjudge the Class 3 claims of that association to have been paid to the 
extent of the amount of unreasonable expenses thus paid from those assets.</P>
<P>If the receiver determines that the assets of the estate will be sufficient 
to pay all Class 1 claims in full, Class 2 claims shall be paid, provided that 
the liquidator shall secure from each of the associations receiving 
disbursements pursuant to this section an agreement to return to the liquidator 
such disbursements, together with investment income actually earned on such 
disbursements, as may be required to pay Class 1 claims. No bond shall be 
required of any such association.</P>
<P>3. Class 3. All claims under policies including claims of the federal or any 
state or local government for losses incurred ("loss claims") including 
third-party claims, claims for unearned premiums, all claims of a guaranty 
association for payment of covered claims or covered obligations of the insurer 
and all claims of a guaranty association for reasonable expenses other than 
those included in Class 2. All claims under life and health insurance and 
annuity policies, whether for death proceeds, health benefits, annuity proceeds, 
or investment values shall be treated as loss claims. That portion of any loss, 
indemnification for which is provided by other benefits or advantages recovered 
by the claimant, shall not be included in this class, other than benefits or 
advantages recovered or recoverable in discharge of familial obligation of 
support or by way of succession at death or as proceeds of life insurance, or as 
gratuities. No payment by an employer to his employee shall be treated as a 
gratuity.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following claims shall be excluded from 
Class 3 priority:</P>
<P>a. obligations of the insolvent insurer arising out of reinsurance 
contracts,</P>
<P>b. obligations incurred after the expiration date of the insurance policy or 
after the policy has been replaced by the insured or canceled at the insured's 
request or after the policy has been canceled as provided in this act. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, earned premium claims on 
policies, other than reinsurance agreements, shall not be excluded,</P>
<P>c. obligations to insurers, insurance pools or underwriting associations and 
their claims for contribution, indemnity or subrogation, equitable or 
otherwise,</P>
<P>d. any claim which is in excess of any applicable limits provided in the 
insurance policy issued by the insolvent insurer,</P>
<P>e. any amount accrued as punitive or exemplary damages unless expressly 
covered under the terms of the policy, and</P>
<P>f. tort claims of any kind against the insurer, and claims against the 
insurer for bad faith or wrongful settlement practices.</P>
<P>4. Class 4. Claims of the federal government other than those claims included 
in Class 3.</P>
<P>5. Class 5. Debts due employees for services, benefits, contractual or 
otherwise due arising out of such reasonable compensation to employees for 
services performed to the extent that they do not exceed two (2) months of 
monetary compensation and represent payment for services performed within six 
(6) months before the filing of the petition for liquidation or, if 
rehabilitation preceded liquidation, within one (1) year before the filing of 
the petition for rehabilitation. Principal officers and directors shall not be 
entitled to the benefit of this priority except as otherwise approved by the 
liquidator and the court. This priority shall be in lieu of any other similar 
priority which may be authorized by law as to wages or compensation of 
employees.</P>
<P>6. Class 6. Claims of any person, including claims of state or local 
governments, except those specifically classified elsewhere in this section.</P>
<P>7. Class 7. Claims for commissions and service fees, and claims of attorneys 
for fees and expenses owed them by a person for services rendered in opposing a 
formal delinquency proceeding. In order to prove the claim, the claimant must 
show that the insurer which is the subject of the delinquency proceeding 
incurred such fees and expenses based on its best knowledge, information and 
belief, formed after reasonable inquiry indicating opposition was in the best 
interests of the person, was well grounded in fact and was warranted by existing 
law or a good-faith argument for the extension, modification or reversal of 
existing law, and that opposition was not pursued for any improper purpose, such 
as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of 
the litigation.</P>
<P>8. Class 8. Claims of any state or local government for a penalty or 
forfeiture, but only to the extent of the pecuniary loss sustained from the act, 
transaction or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with 
reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby. The remainder of such claims 
shall be postponed to the class of claims under paragraph 9 of this 
subsection.</P>
<P>9. Class 9. Surplus or contribution notes or similar obligations, premium 
refunds on assessable policies, interest on claims of Classes 1 through 8 and 
any other claims specifically subordinated to this class.</P>
<P>10. Class 10.</P>
<P>a. Claims of shareholders or other owners arising out of their capacity as 
shareholders or other owners, or arising in any other capacity or facts except 
as they may be qualified in Class 3 or 4 above; provided, however, that no 
shareholder, member or other owner shall be entitled to, or receive, any 
distribution from the insolvent insurers estate under this paragraph, if:</P>
<P>(1) the intentional wrongdoing, fraud, gross negligence, negligence or other 
act, failure to act, transaction or proceeding of such shareholder, member or 
owner, alone or in concert with others, or of a director or officer of the 
insolvent insurer, is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the 
receiver in his or her reasonable discretion, to have caused, or to have been a 
contributing factor to, the insolvency of the insolvent insurer, </P>
<P>(2) funds were collected from the shareholder, member or other owner, either 
directly or through an insurance carrier, fidelity bond issuer or other entity, 
as a consequence of, or related to, a claim made or brought by the receiver of 
said insurer, or </P>
<P>(3) any of the funds available for distribution consist of punitive damages 
recovered by the receiver of said estate from any source based upon any claim 
made or brought by the receiver. </P>
<P>In the event there is no eligible shareholder, member or other owner entitled 
to distribution in accordance with this paragraph, the remaining funds and other 
property of the insolvent insurers estate, if any, shall be distributed to a 
fund established and held in the name of, and for the use and benefit of, the 
receiver, through the Oklahoma Receivership Office or any similar entity 
established by the receiver, which shall be used in the administration of other 
insurers in rehabilitation or liquidation. </P>
<P>b. All funds distributed to the receiver under this paragraph shall be 
utilized by the receivers staff engaged in the rehabilitation or liquidation of 
insolvent insurance business companies for the following purposes:</P>
<P>(1) the administration of liquidations of estates which temporarily or 
permanently do not have the financial capability to administer the liquidation, 
including the prosecution of claims of the receiver, or</P>
<P>(2) the prosecution of petitions to place insurers in rehabilitation or 
liquidation.</P>
<P>In the event such funds are distributed to or for an insolvent insurer, the 
receiver shall obtain from the insurer a promissory note or other evidence of 
indebtedness, secured by collateral if possible, for the amount distributed, 
which shall be treated as a Class 1 expense under paragraph 1 of this 
subsection. The receiver shall make good-faith efforts to collect reimbursement 
of any such loans. No funds distributed to the receiver under this paragraph 
shall be used to pay claims other than Class 1 claims under paragraph 1 of this 
subsection. The funds are not funds of the State of Oklahoma and are not funds 
of the Oklahoma Insurance Department or any other agency of the State of 
Oklahoma.</P>
<P>This paragraph shall apply to the administration of all receivership estates 
open and ongoing as of November 1, 2014, and to all receivership proceedings 
commenced after November 1, 2014.</P>
<P>C. If any claimant of this state, another state or foreign country shall be 
entitled to or shall receive a dividend upon his or her claim out of a statutory 
deposit or the proceeds of any bond or other asset located in another state or 
foreign country, unless such deposit or proceeds shall have been delivered to 
the domiciliary liquidator, then the claimants shall not be entitled to any 
further dividend from the receiver until and unless all other claimants of the 
same class, irrespective of residence or place of the acts or contracts upon 
which their claims are based, shall have received an equal dividend upon their 
claims, and after such equalization, such claimants shall be entitled to share 
in the distribution of further dividends by the receiver, along with and like 
all other creditors of the same class, wheresoever residing.</P>
<P>D. Upon the declaration of a dividend, the receiver shall apply the amount of 
the dividend against any indebtedness owed to the insurer by the person entitled 
to the dividend. There shall be no claim allowed for any deductible charged by a 
guaranty association or entity performing a similar function.</P>
<P>E. This section shall apply to pending and future claims in existing 
delinquency proceedings as well as to claims in delinquency proceedings arising 
after the effective date of this section.</P>
<P>F. If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person 
or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other 
provisions or application of this section to the extent such other provisions or 
application can be given effect without the invalid provision or 
application.</P>
