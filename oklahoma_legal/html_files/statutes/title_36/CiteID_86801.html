<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Additional information in such form and detail as 
the Commissioner may prescribe or request shall be furnished and

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If the solicitation is made on behalf of the 
management of the insurer and relates to an annual meeting of stockholders at 
which directors are to be elected, each proxy statement furnished pursuant to 
subsection one hereof shall be accompanied or preceded by an annual report (in 
preliminary or final form) to such stockholders containing such financial 
statements for the last fiscal year as are referred to in Schedule SIS under the 
heading "Financial Reporting to Stockholders." Subject to the foregoing 
requirements with respect to financial statements, the annual report to

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Means shall be provided in the proxy for the 
person solicited to specify by ballot a choice between approval or disapproval 
of each matter or group of related matters referred to therein, other than 
elections to office. A proxy may confer discretionary authority with respect to 
matters as to which a choice is not so specified if the form of proxy states in 
boldface type how it is intended to vote the shares or authorization represented 
by the proxy in each such case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. A proxy may confer discretionary authority with 
respect to other matters which may come before the meeting, provided the persons 
on whose behalf the solicitation is made are not aware a reasonable time prior 
to the time the solicitation is made that any other matters are to be presented 
for action at the meeting and provided further that a specific statement to that 
effect is made in the proxy statement or in the form of proxy. A proxy may also 
confer discretionary authority with respect to any proposal omitted from the 
proxy statement and form of proxy pursuant to Paragraph H.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. No proxy shall confer authority (a) to vote for 
the election of any person to any office for which a bona fide nominee is not

the next annual meeting (or any adjournment thereof) to be held after the date 
on which the proxy statement and form of proxy are first sent or given to 
stockholders.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The proxy statement or form of proxy shall 
provide, subject to reasonable specified conditions, that the proxy will be 
voted and that where the person solicited specifies by means of ballot provided 
pursuant to subparagraph 2 of this Paragraph F a choice with respect to any 
matter to be acted upon, the vote will be in accordance with the specifications 
so made.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. The information included in the proxy statement 
shall be clearly presented and the statements made shall be divided into groups 
according to subject matter, with appropriate headings. All printed proxy 
statements shall be clearly and legibly presented.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. Material required to be filed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Two preliminary copies of the proxy statement and 
form of proxy and any other soliciting material to be furnished to stockholders 
concurrently therewith shall be filed with the Commissioner at least ten days

stockholders, or such shorter period prior to that date as the Commissioner may 
authorize upon a written showing of good cause therefor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Two preliminary copies of any additional 
soliciting material relating to the same meeting or subject matter to be

the Commissioner at least two days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) 
prior to the date copies of this material are first sent or given to 
stockholders or a shorter period prior to such date as the Commissioner may 
authorize upon a written showing of good cause therefor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Two definitive copies of the proxy statement, form 
of proxy and all other soliciting material, in the form in which this material 
is furnished to stockholders, shall be filed with, or mailed for filing to, the 
Commissioner not later than the date such material is first sent or given to the 
stockholders.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Where any proxy statement, form of proxy or other 
material filed pursuant to this act is amended or revised, two of the copies 
shall be marked to clearly show such changes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Copies of replies to inquiries from stockholders 
requesting further information and copies of communications which do no more 
than request that forms of proxy theretofore solicited be signed and returned 
need not be filed pursuant to this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs 1 
and 2 hereof and of subparagraph 5 of Paragraph K, copies of soliciting material 
in the form of speeches, press releases and radio or television scripts may, but 
need not, be filed with the Commissioner prior to use or publication. Definitive

required by subparagraph 3 of this Paragraph G not later than the date such

means of any proxy statement, form of proxy, notice of meeting, or other 
communication, written or oral, containing any statement which at the time and 
in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading 
with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact 
necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or 
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to 
the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has 
become false or misleading.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. Prohibition of certain solicitations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>No person making a solicitation which is subject to 
this act shall solicit any undated or postdated proxy or any proxy which
