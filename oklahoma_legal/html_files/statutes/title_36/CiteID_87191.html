<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. Definitions. The term "operative date of the valuation manual" means the 
January 1 of the first calendar year that the valuation manual, as defined in 
the Section 1510 of this title, is effective.</P>
<P>B. No policy of life insurance, except as set forth in subsection M of this 
section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it shall 
contain in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which 
are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are 
the minimum requirements hereinafter specified and are essentially in compliance 
with subsection L of this section:</P>
<P>1. That in the event of default in any premium payment, after premiums have 
been paid for at least three (3) full years, the insurer will grant, upon proper 
request not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of the premium in 
default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, 
effective as of such due date, of such amount as may be hereinafter specified. 
In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may 
substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty (60) days after the due 
date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death 
benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment 
benefits.</P>
<P>2. That upon surrender of the policy within sixty (60) days after the due 
date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at 
least three (3) full years in the case of ordinary insurance, or five (5) full 
years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any 
paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be 
hereinafter specified.</P>
<P>3. That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as 
specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects 
another available option not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of 
the premium in default.</P>
<P>4. That if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of all premium 
payments, or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which 
became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of 
ordinary insurance, or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial 
insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty (30) 
days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may 
be hereinafter specified.</P>
<P>5. In the case of policies which cause, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, 
unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for 
changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement 
of the mortality table, interest rate and method used in calculating cash 
surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the 
policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table 
and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing 
the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, 
available under the policy on each policy anniversary, either during the first 
twenty (20) policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, 
such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no 
dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no 
indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.</P>
<P>6. An explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the 
paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up 
additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the 
policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and 
benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method 
of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the 
state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used 
in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit 
available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary 
for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.</P>
<P>C. Any of the provisions or portions thereof set forth in paragraphs 1 
through 6 of subsection B of this section which are not applicable by reason of 
the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the 
policy. The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash 
surrender value for a period of six (6) months after demand therefor with 
surrender of the policy.</P>
<P>D. Cash surrender value: The policy must comply with the requirements of one 
of the following paragraphs:</P>
<P>1. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of 
default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not 
required by subsection B of this section, shall be at least equal to the reserve 
on the policy at date of default and on any paid-up additions thereto, less a 
sum of not more than two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the amount insured by 
the policy and of the paid-up additions thereto, if any, and less any existing 
indebtedness to the company on or secured by the policy; the reserve on such 
policy to be computed in accordance with the mortality table and the rate of 
interest specified in the policy for the calculation of the cash value and by 
the net level premium method of valuation unless a modified net premium method 
of valuation be specified in the policy. No cash surrender value shall be 
required in policies of term insurance of twenty (20) years or less.</P>
<P>2. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of 
default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not 
required by subsection B of this section, shall be an amount not less than the 
excess, if any, of the present value on such anniversary of the future 
guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including 
any existing paid-up additions if there had been no default over the sum of (i) 
the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsections G, H 
and I of this section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on 
and after such anniversary, and (ii) the amount of any indebtedness to the 
insurer on account of or secured by the policy.</P>
<P>3. Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative 
date of paragraph 4 of subsection I of this section as defined therein, which 
provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the 
insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental 
policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph 2 of this 
subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value 
as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same 
age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender 
value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits 
otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.</P>
<P>4. Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the 
operative date of paragraph 4 of subsection I of this section as defined 
therein, which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life 
of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age 
seventy-one (71) years, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph 2 of 
this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender 
value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the 
same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash 
surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only 
the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the 
spouse.</P>
<P>5. Any cash surrender value available within thirty (30) days after any 
policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium 
payments, or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, 
whether or not required by subsection B, shall be an amount not less than the 
present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided 
for by the policy including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any 
indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy. The method 
described in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this subsection may be referred to as 
the Standard Nonforfeiture Value Method.</P>
<P>E. Notification to policyholder of cash surrender value: Within three (3) 
months after default of any premium payment on any life insurance policy which 
has a cash surrender value, the insurer shall notify the policyholder in writing 
of the cash surrender value and of the policyholder's options as to the 
application of the cash surrender value as provided in the policy.</P>
<P>F. Paid-up nonforfeiture benefits: Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit 
available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on 
any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such 
anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided 
for by the policy, or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which 
would have been required by this section in the absence of the condition that 
premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.</P>
<P>G. The adjusted premium: This subsection shall not apply to policies issued 
on or after the operative date of paragraph 4 of subsection I of this section as 
defined therein. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of subsection H of this 
section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual 
basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified 
in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard 
policy, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such 
adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:</P>
<P>(i) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by 
the policy;</P>
<P>(ii) two percent (2%) of the amount of the insurance if the insurance be 
uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as hereinafter defined, 
if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy;</P>
<P>(iii) forty percent (40%) of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; 
and</P>
<P>(iv) twenty-five percent (25%) of either the adjusted premium for the first 
policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform 
or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued 
at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less, provided, 
however, that in applying the percentages specified in clauses (iii) and (iv) 
above, no adjusted premiums shall be deemed to exceed four percent (4%) of the 
amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto.</P>
<P>The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the 
date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.</P>
<P>H. 1. This subsection shall not apply to policies issued on or after the 
operative date of paragraph 4 of subsection I of this section as defined 
therein. In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with 
the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the 
purpose of subsection G of this section shall be deemed to be the uniform amount 
of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same 
endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same 
term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under 
which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the 
policy, provided, however, that in the case of a policy providing a varying 
amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten (10) years, the 
equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance 
provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten (10) years were the 
amount provided by such policy at age ten (10) years.</P>
<P>2. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by 
rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (a) the adjusted 
premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such 
term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for 
such term insurance benefits are payable, by (b) the adjusted premiums for such 
term insurance, the foregoing items (a) and (b) being calculated separately and 
as specified in subsection G of this section and paragraph 1 of this subsection 
except that, for the purposes of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of subsection G of 
this section, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance 
used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in (b) shall be 
equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy 
over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in (a).</P>
<P>I. 1. This paragraph shall not apply to policies issued on or after the 
operative date of paragraph 4 of this subsection as defined therein. For 
policies which comply with the requirements of paragraph 2 of subsection 
<STRIKE>C</STRIKE> D of this section and except as otherwise provided in 
paragraphs 2 and 3 of this subsection, all adjusted premiums and present values 
referred to in this section shall for policies of ordinary insurance be 
calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality 
Table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female 
risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an 
age not more than three (3) years younger than the actual age of the insured, 
and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on 
the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations 
shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and 
one-half percent (3 1/2%) per annum, specified in the policy for calculating 
cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided, however, 
that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with 
accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the 
rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty percent 
(130%) of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table, provided 
further that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any 
such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of 
mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Insurance 
Commissioner.</P>
<P>2. This paragraph shall not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the 
operative date of paragraph 4 of this subsection as defined therein. In the case 
of ordinary policies which comply with the requirements of paragraph 2 of 
subsection D of this section issued on or after July 1, 1962, all adjusted 
premiums and present values referred to in this section may be calculated on the 
basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate 
of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and 
paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not 
exceed three and one-half percent (3 1/2%) per annum except that a rate of 
interest not exceeding four percent (4%) per annum may be used for policies 
issued on or after April 11, 1974, and prior to March 17, 1978, and rate of 
interest not exceeding five and one-half percent (5 1/2%) per annum may be used 
for policies issued on or after March 17, 1978, and provided that for any 
category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and 
present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six (6) years 
younger than the actual age of the insured. Provided, however, that in 
calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying 
pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of 
mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 
Extended Term Insurance Table. Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a 
substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present 
values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the 
company and approved by the Commissioner.</P>
<P>3. This paragraph shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after 
the operative date of paragraph 4 of this subsection as defined therein. In the 
case of industrial policies, which comply with the requirements of paragraph 2 
of subsection D of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values 
referred to in this section may be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 
1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in 
the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture 
benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half 
percent (3 1/2%) per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four 
percent (4%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after April 11, 
1974, and prior to March 17, 1978, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and 
one-half percent (5 1/2%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after 
March 17, 1978. Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any 
paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a 
nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those 
shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. 
Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the 
calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on 
such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by 
the Commissioner.</P>
<P>4. (a) This paragraph shall apply to all policies issued on or after the 
operative date of this paragraph as defined herein. Except as provided in 
subparagraph (g) of this paragraph, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall 
be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the 
respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding 
amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and 
also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the 
policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender 
values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date 
of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of 
(i) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the 
policy; (ii) one percent (1%) of either the amount of insurance, if the 
insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the 
beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years; and (iii) one hundred 
twenty-five percent (125%) of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter 
defined. Provided, however, that in applying the percentage specified in (iii) 
above no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent 
(4%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, 
or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten 
(10) policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this 
paragraph shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is 
determined.</P>
<P>(b) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, 
at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by 
the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of 
an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on 
each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.</P>
<P>(c) In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy 
unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for 
changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the 
adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the 
assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated 
at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the 
benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level 
premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future 
benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy 
immediately after the change.</P>
<P>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (g) of this paragraph, the 
recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform 
percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each 
policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments 
and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or 
policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in 
calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that 
the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or 
premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess 
of</P>
<P>(A) the sum of</P>
<P>(i) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided 
for by the policy and</P>
<P>(ii) the additional expense allowance, if any, over</P>
<P>(B) the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.</P>
<P>(e) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly 
defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of</P>
<P>(i) one percent (1%) of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of 
insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years subsequent 
to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the 
beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years subsequent to the time of 
the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the 
date of issue of the policy; and</P>
<P>(ii) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the increase, if positive, in 
the nonforfeiture net level premium.</P>
<P>(f) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the 
result obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where</P>
<P>(A) equals the sum of</P>
<P>(i) the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times 
the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of 
the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would 
have fallen due had the change not occurred, and</P>
<P>(ii) the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided 
for by the policy, and</P>
<P>(B) equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each 
anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a 
premium falls due.</P>
<P>(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph to the contrary, 
in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced 
graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the 
same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the 
standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted 
premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if 
it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the 
standard basis.</P>
<P>(h) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section 
shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of (i) 
the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or (ii) at the election 
of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the 
Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select 
Mortality Factors; shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated 
on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and 
shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the 
basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as 
defined in this paragraph for policies issued in that calendar year. Provided, 
however, that:</P>
<P>(i) At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a 
particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not 
exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this paragraph, for 
policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.</P>
<P>(ii) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend 
additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by 
subsection B of this section, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality 
table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.</P>
<P>(iii) An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the 
basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for 
calculating cash surrender values.</P>
<P>(iv) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with 
accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the 
rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 
1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not 
more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for 
policies of industrial insurance.</P>
<P>(v) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such 
adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications 
of the aforementioned tables.</P>
<P>(vi) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, 
any Commissioners Standard mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by regulation 
promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture 
standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary 
Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the 
Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table.</P>
<P>For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, 
the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners Standard mortality table 
for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be 
substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or 
without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended 
Term Insurance Table. If the commissioner approves by rule any Commissioners 
Standard mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for 
policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that 
minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard 
provided by the valuation manual, and</P>
<P>(vii) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation 
manual, any Commissioners Standard industrial mortality tables, adopted after 
1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved 
by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum 
nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard 
Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term 
Insurance Table.</P>
<P>For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual 
the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioner's Standard mortality table 
for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be 
substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or 
the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the 
commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioner's Standard industrial 
mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on 
or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum 
nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by 
the valuation manual.</P>
<P>(i) The nonforfeiture interest rate is defined below:</P>
<P>(i) For policies issued prior to the operative date of valuation manual, the 
nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular 
calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the 
calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in 
the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of one percent 
(1/4 of 1%); provided, however, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not 
be less than four percent (4%), and</P>
<P>(ii) For policies issued on and after the operative date of the valuation 
manual the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a 
particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.</P>
<P>(j) Notwithstanding any other provision in this code to the contrary, any 
refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any 
previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest 
rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require 
refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.</P>
<P>(k) Any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its 
election to comply with the provisions of this paragraph after a specified date 
before January 1, 1989, which specified date shall be the operative date of this 
paragraph for such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative 
date of this paragraph for such insurer shall be January 1, 1989.</P>
<P>J. In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future 
premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer 
based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life 
insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by 
the methods described in subsections B through I of this section:</P>
<P>1. The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the 
plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum 
benefits otherwise required by subsections B through I of this section;</P>
<P>2. The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of 
premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or 
insureds;</P>
<P>3. The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by 
such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the 
plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this Standard 
Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, as determined by regulations promulgated 
by the Commissioner.</P>
<P>K. Calculation of Values: Any cash surrender value and any paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a 
premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be 
calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional 
premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary, except in the case of 
industrial insurance proportionate increases in value may be calculated on the 
basis of quarter-year payments. All values referred to in subsections D, F, G, H 
and I of this section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death 
benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any 
paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the 
amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
subsection D of this section, additional benefits payable (1) in the event of 
death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means, (2) in the event of 
total and permanent disability, (3) as reversionary annuity or deferred 
reversionary annuity benefits, (4) as term insurance benefits provided by a 
rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, 
this section would not apply, (5) as term insurance on the life of a child or on 
the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, 
if such term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six (26) years, 
is uniform in amount after the child's age is one (1) year, and has not become 
paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child, and (6) as other policy 
benefits additional to life insurance and endorsement benefits, and premiums for 
all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash 
surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no 
such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefits.</P>
<P>L. This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this 
section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986. Any 
cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a 
premium payment due on any policy anniversary, shall be in an amount which does 
not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent (2/10 of 1%) of either the 
amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average 
amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years, 
from the sum of (a) the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter 
specified and (b) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the 
amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.</P>
<P>The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such 
anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided 
for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction 
of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then 
present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, 
corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such 
anniversary. Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of 
supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as 
described in subsection&nbsp;D or H of this section, whichever is applicable, 
shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection D or H of this 
section, whichever is applicable on the cash surrender values defined in that 
subsection.</P>
<P>The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a 
percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection 
G or I of this section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by the 
next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:</P>
<P>1. Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy 
anniversary and the later of (i) the fifth policy anniversary and (ii) the first 
policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender 
value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting 
any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one percent (2/10 of 1%) of either 
the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average 
amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years; 
and</P>
<P>2. Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy 
anniversaries specified in the preceding paragraph 1 may apply to fewer than 
five (5) consecutive policy years.</P>
<P>Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be 
obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection G or 
I of this section, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the 
nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.</P>
<P>All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall 
for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases 
as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections 
of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall 
include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.</P>
<P>Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a 
premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a 
premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners 
specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections B, C, D 
and K and paragraph 4 of subsection I of this section. The amounts of any cash 
surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection 
with additional benefits such as those listed as items (1) through (6) in 
subsection K of this section shall conform with the principles of this 
subsection.</P>
<P>M. 1. This section shall not apply to any of the following:</P>
<P>a. reinsurance,</P>
<P>b. group insurance,</P>
<P>c. pure endowment,</P>
<P>d. annuity or reversionary annuity contract,</P>
<P>e. except as provided in paragraph 1 of subsection D of this section, term 
policy of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or 
endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of twenty (20) years or less expiring 
before age seventy-one (71) years, for which uniform premiums are payable during 
the entire term of the policy,</P>
<P>f. except as provided in paragraph 1 of subsection D of this section, term 
policy of decreasing amount which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or 
endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in 
subsections G, H and I of this section, is less than the adjusted premium so 
calculated on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which 
provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same 
age and for the same initial amount of insurance for a term defined as follows: 
For ages at issue fifty (50) years and under the term shall be twenty (20) 
years. Thereafter the term shall decrease one (1) year for each year of increase 
in the age at issue beyond age fifty (50) years; and</P>
<P>g. policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, 
for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up 
nonforfeiture benefit at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as 
specified in subsections D, F, G, H and I of this section, exceeds two and 
one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the 
same policy year.</P>
<P>2. For purposes of determining the applicability of this act, the age at 
expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the 
oldest life.</P>
