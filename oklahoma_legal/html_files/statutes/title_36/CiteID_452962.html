<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>A. The purpose of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear 
and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of viatical settlements and to 
assure the clear, truthful and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, 
limitations and exclusions of any viatical settlement contract. This purpose is 
intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of 
permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical settlements 
to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents 
unfair, deceptive or misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate 
presentation and description of viatical settlements through the advertising 
media and material used by viatical settlement licensees.</P>
<P>B. This section shall apply to any advertising of viatical settlement 
contracts or related products or services intended for dissemination in this 
state, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state. 
Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, 
this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with 
federal regulation wherever possible.</P>
<P>C. Every viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times 
maintain a system of control over the content, form and method of dissemination 
of all advertisements of its contracts, products and services. All 
advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed or presented, 
shall be the responsibility of the viatical settlement licensees, as well as the 
individual who created or presented the advertisement. A system of control shall 
include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others 
authorized by the viatical settlement licensee who disseminate advertisements of 
the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of any 
advertisements not furnished by the viatical settlement licensee.</P>
<P>D. Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by 
implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement 
contract shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It 
shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an 
advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be 
determined by the Insurance Commissioner from the overall impression that the 
advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average 
education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is 
directed.</P>
<P>E. The information required to be disclosed under this section shall not be 
minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or 
intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or 
misleading.</P>
<P>1. An advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, 
phrases, statements, references or illustrations if the omission or use has the 
capacity, tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature 
or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable, or state or federal tax 
consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement contract offered is made 
available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is made 
to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical 
settlement contract includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds 
legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.</P>
<P>2. An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance 
company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by 
the insurer.</P>
<P>3. An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an 
accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable or in any 
manner an incorrect or improper practice.</P>
<P>4. The words "free", "no cost", "without cost", "no additional cost", "at no 
extra cost", or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any 
benefit or service unless true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a 
benefit or a service or may state that a charge is included in the payment or 
use other appropriate language.</P>
<P>5. Testimonials, appraisals or analysis used in advertisements must be 
genuine; represent the current opinion of the author; be applicable to the 
viatical settlement contract, product or service advertised, if any; and be 
accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or 
deceiving prospective viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, 
appraisal, analysis or endorsement. In using testimonials, appraisals or 
analysis, a licensee under the Viatical Settlements Act of 2008 makes as its own 
all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the 
provisions of this section.</P>
<P>a. If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis or an 
endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, 
appraisal, analysis or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity 
as a stockholder, director, officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any 
benefit directly or indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact 
shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.</P>
<P>b. An advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement 
contract, benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of 
individuals, society, association or other organization unless that is the fact 
and unless any relationship between an organization and the viatical settlement 
licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is 
owned, controlled or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, or receives 
any payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for 
making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the 
advertisement.</P>
<P>c. When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical 
settlement contract all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of 
five (5) years after its use.</P>
<P>F. An advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless it 
accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used 
in an advertisement shall be identified.</P>
<P>G. An advertisement shall not disparage insurers, viatical settlement 
providers, viatical settlement brokers, viatical settlement investment agents, 
insurance producers, policies, services or methods of marketing.</P>
<P>H. The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall be clearly identified 
in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contract, 
products or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract is 
advertised, the viatical settlement contract shall be identified either by form 
number or some other appropriate description. If an application is part of the 
advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider shall be shown on 
the application.</P>
<P>I. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of 
the parent company of a viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular 
division of the viatical settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol or 
other device or reference without disclosing the name of the viatical settlement 
licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or 
deceive as to the true identity of the viatical settlement licensee, or to 
create the impression that a company other than the viatical settlement licensee 
would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical 
settlement contract.</P>
<P>J. An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols or 
physical materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color or other 
characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, symbols or physical 
materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of 
such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that 
the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or 
agency.</P>
<P>K. An advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed 
in the state where the advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate 
that fact or suggest or imply that competing viatical settlement licensees may 
not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the audience to consult the 
licensees web site or contact the department of insurance to find out if the 
state requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider, 
viatical settlement broker is licensed.</P>
<P>L. An advertisement shall not create the impression that the viatical 
settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its 
claims or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement 
contracts are recommended or endorsed by any government entity.</P>
<P>M. The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its 
advertisements. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group 
designation, name of any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, 
service mark, slogan, symbol or other device in a manner that would have the 
capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual 
licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity 
would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.</P>
<P>N. An advertisement shall not directly or indirectly create the impression 
that any division or agency of the state or of the federal government endorses, 
approves or favors:</P>
<P>1. Any viatical settlement licensee or its business practices or methods of 
operation;</P>
<P>2. The merits, desirability or advisability of any viatical settlement 
contract;</P>
<P>3. Any viatical settlement contract; or</P>
<P>4. Any life insurance policy or life insurance company.</P>
<P>O. If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will 
occur, the advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed 
application to the date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of 
the funds by the viator.</P>
<P>P. If the advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the 
advertising shall disclose the average purchase price as a percent of face value 
obtained by viators contracting with the licensee during the past six (6) 
months.</P></FONT>
