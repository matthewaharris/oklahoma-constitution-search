<P>A. Each group accident and health policy shall contain in substance the 
following provisions:</P>
<P>1. A provision that, in the absence of fraud, all statements made by the 
policyholder or by any insured person shall be deemed representations and not 
warranties, and that no statement made for the purpose of effecting insurance 
shall avoid such insurance or reduce benefits unless contained in a written 
instrument signed by the policyholder or the insured person, a copy of which has 
been furnished to such policyholder or to such person or his or her 
beneficiary;</P>
<P>2. A provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder, for 
delivery to each employee or member of the insured group, an individual 
certificate setting forth in summary form a statement of the essential features 
of the insurance coverage of such employee or member and to whom benefits are 
payable. If dependents or family members are included in the coverage additional 
certificates need not be issued for delivery to such dependents or family 
members; and</P>
<P>3. A provision that to the group originally insured may be added from time to 
time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case may be, in 
accordance with the terms of the policy.</P>
<P>B. Each group health policy certificate subject to the provisions of the 
Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Public Law 104-191, 
(HIPAA) laws shall contain in substance the following provisions, which shall be 
in addition to the provisions required by subsection A of this section.</P>
<P>1. A provision that a health benefit plan shall not deny, exclude or limit 
benefits for a covered individual for losses incurred more than twelve (12) 
months following the effective date of the individual's coverage due to a 
preexisting condition;</P>
<P>2. A provision that a health benefit plan shall not define a preexisting 
condition more restrictively than:</P>
<P>a. a condition for which medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment was 
recommended or received during the six (6) months immediately preceding the 
effective date of coverage,</P>
<P>b. pregnancy and genetic information shall not be considered preexisting 
conditions,</P>
<P>c. a health benefit plan may exclude a preexisting condition for late 
enrollees for a period not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date the 
individual enrolls for coverage,</P>
<P>d. the period of any such preexisting condition exclusion shall be reduced by 
the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage as defined in the Federal 
HIPAA laws,</P>
<P>e. a period of creditable coverage shall not be counted if after such period 
and before the enrollment date, there was a sixty-three-day period during all of 
which the individual was not covered under any creditable coverage,</P>
<P>f. "enrollment date" means the date of enrollment of the individual in the 
plan or coverage or, if earlier, the first day of the waiting period for such 
enrollment, and</P>
<P>g. "late enrollee" means a participant or beneficiary who enrolls under the 
plan other than during the first period in which the individual is eligible to 
enroll under the plan or a special enrollment period;</P>
<P>3. A provision that individuals losing other coverage shall be permitted to 
enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if each of the following 
conditions is met:</P>
<P>a. the employee or dependent was covered under a group health plan or had 
health insurance coverage at the time coverage was previously offered to the 
employee or dependent,</P>
<P>b. the employee stated in writing at such time that coverage under a group 
health plan or health insurance coverage was the reason for declining 
enrollment, but only if the plan sponsor or issuer required such a statement at 
such time and provided the employee with notice of such requirement, and the 
consequences of such requirement, at such time,</P>
<P>c. the employee's or dependent's coverage was under a COBRA continuation 
provision and the coverage under such provision was exhausted; or was not under 
such a provision and either the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of 
eligibility for the coverage, including as a result of legal separation, 
divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in the number of hours 
of employment, or employer contributions toward such coverage were terminated, 
and</P>
<P>d. under the terms of the plan, the employee requests such enrollment not 
later than thirty (30) days after the date of exhaustion of coverage;</P>
<P>4. A provision that for any period that an individual is in a waiting period 
for any coverage under a group health plan or for group health insurance 
coverage or is in an affiliation period, that period shall not be taken into 
account in determining the continuous period of creditable coverage. 
"Affiliation period" means a period which, under the terms of the health 
insurance coverage offered by a health maintenance organization, must expire 
before the health insurance coverage becomes effective. The organization is not 
required to provide health care services or benefits during such period and no 
premium shall be charged to the participant or beneficiary for any coverage 
during the period;</P>
<P>5. A provision that preexisting condition exclusions will not apply to 
newborns, who, as the last day of the thirty-day period beginning with the date 
of birth, are covered under creditable coverage;</P>
<P>6. A provision that preexisting condition exclusions will not apply to a 
child who is adopted or placed for adoption before attaining eighteen (18) years 
of age;</P>
<P>7. A provision that dependents are eligible for a special enrollment period 
if the group health plan makes coverage available with respect to a dependent of 
an individual, and the individual is a participant under the plan, or has met 
any waiting period applicable to becoming a participant under the plan and is 
eligible to be enrolled under the plan but for a failure to enroll during a 
previous enrollment period, and a person becomes such a dependent of the 
individual through marriage, birth or adoption or placement for adoption. The 
special enrollment period shall apply to that person or, if not otherwise 
enrolled, the individual, the dependent of the individual, and in the case of 
the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the individual may be enrolled 
as a dependent of the individual if such spouse is otherwise eligible for 
coverage.</P>
<P>a. The dependent special enrollment period shall be a period of not less than 
thirty (30) days and shall begin on the later of the date dependent coverage is 
made available, or the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for 
adoption.</P>
<P>b. There is no waiting period if an individual seeks to enroll a dependent 
during the first thirty (30) days of such a dependent special enrollment 
period.</P>
<P>c. The coverage for the dependent shall become effective in the case of 
marriage, not later than the first day of the first month beginning after the 
date the completed request for enrollment is received, in the case of a 
dependent's birth, as of the date of such birth, in the case of a dependent's 
adoption or placement for adoption, the date of such adoption or placement for 
adoption;</P>
<P>8. A provision that eligibility or continued eligibility of any individual 
will not be based on any of the following health-status-related factors in 
relation to the individual or a dependent of the individual: health status, 
medical condition, including both physical and mental illnesses, claims 
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, 
evidence of insurability, including conditions arising out of acts of domestic 
violence or disability.</P>
<P>a. Carriers are not required to provide particular benefits other than those 
provided under the terms of the plan or coverage.</P>
<P>b. Carriers may establish limitations or restrictions on the amount, level, 
extent, and nature of the benefits or coverage for similarly situated 
individuals enrolled in the plan or coverage; and</P>
<P>9. A provision that the group health plan is guaranteed renewable, except as 
provided pursuant to the federal provisions found in HIPAA, which are as 
follows:</P>
<P>a. nonpayment of premium,</P>
<P>b. fraud,</P>
<P>c. violation of participation and/or contribution rules,</P>
<P>d. termination of coverage:</P>
<P>(1) in any case in which an issuer decides to discontinue offering a 
particular type of group health insurance coverage offered in the large or small 
group market, coverage of such type may be discontinued by the issuer only if: 
the issuer provides notice to each plan sponsor provided coverage of this type 
in such market, and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage, 
of such discontinuation at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of the 
discontinuation of such coverage and makes available the option to purchase all 
or, in the case of the large group market, any other health insurance coverage 
currently being offered by the issuer to a group health plan in such market and 
in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering 
the option of coverage pursuant to this provision, the issuer acts uniformly 
without regard to the claims experience of those sponsors or any 
health-status-related factor relating to any participants or beneficiaries 
covered or new participants or beneficiaries who may become eligible for such 
coverage,</P>
<P>(2) in any case in which an issuer decides to discontinue offering a 
particular type of group health insurance coverage offered in the large or small 
group market, coverage of such type may be discontinued by the issuer only if: 
the issuer provides notice to the Oklahoma Insurance Department and to each plan 
sponsor and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage of such 
discontinuation at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date of the 
discontinuation of such coverage; and all health insurance issued or delivered 
for issuance in the state in such market or markets are discontinued and 
coverage under such health insurance coverage in such market or markets is not 
renewed, and</P>
<P>(3) in the case of a discontinuation under division (2) of this subparagraph 
in a market, the issuer shall not provide for the issuance of any health 
insurance coverage in the market and in this state during the five-year period 
beginning on the date of the discontinuation of the last health insurance 
coverage not so renewed,</P>
<P>e. movement outside the service area, and</P>
