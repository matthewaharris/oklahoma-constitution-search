<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Required Provisions. Except as provided in 
subsection D of this section, each such policy delivered or issued for delivery 
to any person in this state shall contain the provisions specified in this 
subsection in the words in which the same appear in this section; provided, 
however, that the insurer may, at its option, substitute for one or more of such 
provisions corresponding provisions of different wording approved by the 
Insurance Commissioner which are in each instance not less favorable in any 
respect to the insured or the beneficiary. Such provisions shall be preceded 
individually by the caption appearing in this subsection or, at the option of 
the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as 
the Insurance Commissioner may approve.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. A provision as follows: ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: 
This policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, 
constitutes the entire contract of insurance. No change in this policy shall be 
valid until approved by an executive officer of the insurer and unless such 
approval be endorsed hereon or attached hereto. No agent has authority to change 
this policy or to waive any of its provisions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A provision as follows: TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN 
DEFENSES:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) After two (2) years from the date of issue of 
this policy, no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the 
applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or 
to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) 
commencing after the expiration of such two-year period. The foregoing policy 
provision shall not be so construed as to affect any legal requirement for 
avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such initial two-year period, 
nor limit the application of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of subsection B of this 
section in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation or other 
insurance. A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject 
to its terms by the timely payment of premium (i) until at least fifty (50) 
years of age or, (ii) in the case of a policy issued to a person older than 
forty-four (44) years of age, for at least five (5) years from its date of 
issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provisions (from which 
the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer's option) under the 
caption "Incontestable". After this policy has been in force for a period of two 
(2) years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which 
the insured is disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements 
contained in the application.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as 
defined in the policy) commencing after two (2) years from the date of issue of 
this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical 
condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective 
on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this 
policy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. A provision as follows: GRACE PERIOD:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) A grace period of ______ (insert a number not 
less than "7" for weekly premium policies, "10" for monthly premium policies and 
"31" for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each 
premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the 
policy shall continue in force.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) A policy in which the insurer reserves the right 
to refuse renewal shall have, at the beginning of the above provision, "Unless 
not less than thirty (30) days prior to the premium due date the insurer has 
delivered to the insured or has mailed to his last address as shown by the 
records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy 
beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. A provision as follows: REINSTATEMENT:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) If any renewal premium be not paid within the 
time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the 
insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such premium, 
without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, 
shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer or such agent 
requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for 
the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval of such 
application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the forty-fifth day 
following the date of such conditional receipt, unless the insurer has 
previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such 
application. The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such 
accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss 
due to such sickness as may begin more than ten (10) days after such date. In 
all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder 
as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted 
premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in 
connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a 
reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been 
previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty (60) days prior to the 
date of reinstatement.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The last sentence of the above provision may be 
omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force 
subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (i) until at least fifty 
(50) years of age or, (ii) in the case of a policy issued to a person older than 
forty-four (44) years of age, for at least five (5) years from its date of 
issue.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. A provision as follows: NOTICE OF 
CLAIM:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Written notice of claim must be given to the 
insurer within twenty (20) days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss 
covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice 
given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at ______ 
(insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the 
purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient 
to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit 
which may be payable for at least two (2) years, an insurer may, at its option, 
insert the following between the first and second sentences of the above 
provision: Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers 
loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at 
least two (2) years, he shall, at least once in every six (6) months after 
having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said 
disability except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six (6) months 
following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on 
account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the 
insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of 
such notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would 
otherwise have accrued during the period of six (6) months preceding the date on 
which such notice is actually given.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. A provision as follows: CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, 
upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant such forms as 
are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss. If such forms are not 
furnished within fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice, the claimant 
shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to 
proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing 
proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the 
extent of the loss for which claim is made.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. A provision as follows: PROOFS OF LOSS: Written 
proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its said office in case of 
claim for loss for which the policy provides any periodic payment contingent 
upon continuing loss within ninety (90) days after the termination of the period 
for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within 
ninety (90) days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish such proof 
within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not 
reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is 
furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence 
of legal capacity, later than one (1) year from the time proof is otherwise 
required.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. A provision as follows: TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: 
Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which 
this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt 
of due written proof of such loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all 
accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment 
will be paid _____ (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently 
than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability 
will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. A provision as follows: PAYMENT OF 
CLAIMS:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in 
accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such 
payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment. If 
no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be 
payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at 
the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such 
beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the 
insured.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The following provisions, or either of them, may 
be included with the foregoing provision at the option of the insurer: If any 
indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an 
insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid 
release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $ 
______ (insert an amount which shall not exceed One Thousand Dollars 
($1,000.00)), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured 
or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. 
Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall 
fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Subject to any written direction of the insured in 
the application or otherwise, all or a portion of any indemnities provided by 
this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, 
at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not 
later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the 
hospital or person rendering such services; but it is not required that the 
service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. A provision as follows: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, 
AUTOPSY:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The insurer at its own expense shall have the right 
and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may 
reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an 
autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. A provision as follows: LEGAL ACTIONS: No action 
at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the 
expiration of sixty (60) days after written proof of loss has been furnished in 
accordance with the requirements of this policy. No such action shall be brought 
after the expiration of three (3) years after the time written proof of loss is 
required to be furnished.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. A provision as follows: CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: 
Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to 
change of beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the 
beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment 
of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other 
changes in this policy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The first clause of this provision, relating to the 
irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's 
option.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Other provisions. Except as provided in subsection 
D of this section, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person 
in this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below 
unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this 
section; provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of 
any such provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by 
the Insurance Commissioner which is not less favorable in any respect to the 
insured or the beneficiary. Any such provision contained in the policy shall be 
preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this subsection 
or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group 
captions or subcaptions as the Insurance Commissioner may approve.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. A provision as follows: CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If 
the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation 
to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this 
policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so 
classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided 
in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within 
the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the 
insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less 
hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of 
such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will 
return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of 
occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of 
such proof, whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the 
classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have 
been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the 
insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the 
state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured 
resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, 
then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be 
those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence 
of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change of occupation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A provision as follows: MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If 
the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy 
shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct 
age.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. A provision as follows: OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS 
INSURER:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If an accident or health or accident and health 
policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force 
concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for _____ (insert type of 
coverage or coverages) in excess of $ ______ (insert maximum limit of indemnity 
or indemnities), the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for 
such excess shall be returned to the insured or to his estate; or, in lieu 
thereof: Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy 
or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the 
insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will 
return all premiums paid for all other such policies.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. A provision as follows: INSURANCE WITH OTHER 
INSURERS:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) If there be other valid coverage, not with this 
insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or 
on an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given 
written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only 
liability under any expense incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such 
proportion of the loss as the amount which would otherwise have been payable 
hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid 
coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total 
like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss, and for the return of such 
portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the amount 
so determined. For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is 
on a provision of service basis, the "like amount" of such other coverage shall 
be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the 
absence of such coverage.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) If the foregoing policy provision is included in 
a policy which also contains the next following policy provision, there shall be 
added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase "Expense Incurred 
Benefits". The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a 
definition of "other valid coverage", approved as to form by the Insurance 
Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage 
provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance 
authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of 
Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other 
coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Insurance Commissioner. 
In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, 
automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or 
medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee 
benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy 
provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such 
insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' 
compensation or employer's liability statute), whether provided by a 
governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be "other 
valid coverage" of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing 
policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as "other 
valid coverage".</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. A provision as follows: INSURANCE WITH OTHER 
INSURERS:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) If there be other valid coverage, not with this 
insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred 
basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the 
occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under 
this policy shall be for such portion of the indemnities otherwise provided 
hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities, of which the insurer had notice 
(including the indemnities under this policy), bear to the total amount of all 
like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the 
premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the indemnities thus 
determined.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) If the foregoing policy provision is included in 
a policy which also contains the next preceding policy provision, there shall be 
added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase "Other Benefits". The 
insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "other 
valid coverage", approved as to form by the Insurance Commissioner, which 
definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by 
organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities 
of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and 
to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Insurance 
Commissioner. In the absence of such definition, such term shall not include 
group insurance or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or 
employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy 
provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such 
insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' 
compensation or employer's liability statute) whether provided by a governmental 
agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be "other valid coverage" 
of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision, 
no third party liability coverage shall be included as "other valid 
coverage".</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. A provision as follows: RELATION OF EARNINGS TO 
INSURANCE:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) If the total monthly amount of loss of time 
benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon 
the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the 
monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average 
monthly earnings for the period of two (2) years immediately preceding a 
disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will 
be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy 
as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the 
insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under 
all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for 
the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two (2) years as shall 
exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid 
hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly benefits 
payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of Two Hundred 
Dollars ($200.00) or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such 
coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits 
other than those payable for loss of time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The foregoing policy provision may be inserted 
only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to 
its terms by the timely payment of premiums (i) until at least fifty (50) years 
of age or, (ii) in the case of a policy issued to a person older than forty-four 
(44) years of age, for at least five (5) years from its date of issue. The 
insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "valid 
loss of time coverage", approved as to form by the Insurance Commissioner, which 
definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by 
governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law 
or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or 
any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be 
approved by the Insurance Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In 
the absence of such definition, such term shall not include any coverage 
provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including 
any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided 
by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit 
organizations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. A provision as follows: UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the 
payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered 
by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. A provision as follows: CONFORMITY WITH STATE 
STATUTES: Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in 
conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on such 
date is hereby amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such 
states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. A provision as follows: ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The 
insurer shall not be liable for any loss to which a contributing cause was the 
insured's commission of or attempt to commit a felony or to which a contributing 
cause was the insured's being engaged in an illegal occupation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. A provision as follows: NARCOTICS: The insurer 
shall not be liable for any loss sustained or contracted in consequence of the 
insured's being under the influence of any narcotic unless administered on the 
advice of a physician.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. A provision as follows: CONTINUITY OF COVERAGE: 
If coverage otherwise terminates as to covered family members, other than for 
nonpayment of premium, nonrenewal of the policy or the expiration of the term 
for which the policy is issued, a covered person (other than one eligible for 
Medicare or any other similar federal program), including the spouse and any 
covered dependent child of the last-named insured or the representative of such 
child, shall have the right to the continuation of coverage under provisions 
which, at the option of the insurer, are consistent with either the continuation 
of the policy with the person exercising the right of continuation designated as 
the named insured; or the issuance of a converted policy with the person 
exercising the conversion right designated as the named insured. Where 
continuation of coverage or conversion is made in the name of the spouse of the 
named insured, such coverage may, at the option of such spouse, include covered 
dependent children for whom such spouse has responsibility for care and support. 
The person who accepts the conversion policy shall become the insured and pay 
the premiums direct to the insurer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Coverage continued through the issuance of a 
converted policy shall consist of a form of coverage then being offered by the 
insurer as a conversion policy in the jurisdiction where the person exercising 
the conversion right resides. Continued and converted coverages, other than 
those provided through the exercise of continuation or conversion rights 
contained in optionally renewable or limited right of renewal contracts, shall 
contain provisions under which the person exercising the continuation or 
conversion shall have the right to renew the coverage until the attainment of 
the age of eligibility for Medicare or any other similar federal or state health 
insurance program subject to the right of the insurer to nonrenew all such 
policies in this state as a class, or, other renewal provisions that are not 
less favorable to the insured than those contained in the policy from which 
conversion is exercised.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Coverage provided through continuation or 
conversion shall be without additional evidence of insurability except as to 
overinsurance, and shall not impose any preexisting condition limitations or 
other contractual time limitations other than those remaining unexpired under 
the policy or contract from which continuation or conversion is 
exercised.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Benefits otherwise payable under a converted 
policy may be reduced so they are not, during the first policy year of the 
converted policy, in excess of those that would have been payable had the 
coverage under the policy from which conversion is exercised not terminated, and 
by the amount of benefits, if any, payable as to the same loss under the policy 
from which conversion is exercised.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The insurer shall not be required to issue a 
converted policy if at the time of application therefor other coverage exists 
under other health insurance policies, hospital or medical service plan 
corporation contracts, health maintenance organization plans or self-insured 
health benefit plans providing similar benefits, or if the applicant for the 
converted policy is eligible for coverage under a group policy or contract 
providing similar benefits, or is provided with similar benefits required by any 
statute, or is covered under any national, state or governmental plan, which 
together with the converted policy would result in overinsurance according to 
the insurer's underwriting standards.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to 
individual family health insurance policies providing hospital, surgical and 
medical expense benefits or hospital confinement indemnity benefits, individual 
family hospital and medical service plan corporation contracts, and family 
health maintenance organization contracts, delivered or issued for delivery in 
the State of Oklahoma but shall not apply to disability income policies, 
accidental death or dismemberment policies nor to single-term, nonrenewable 
policies.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. 1. The terms "noncancelable" and "guaranteed 
renewable" may be used only in a policy which the insured has the right to 
continue in force by the timely payment of premiums set forth in the policy 
until a person is at least fifty (50) years of age, or in the case of a policy 
issued to a person older than forty-four (44) years of age, for at least five 
(5) years from its date of issue, during which period the insurer has no right 
to make unilaterally any change in any provision of the policy while the policy 
is in force.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Except as provided in paragraph 1 of this 
subsection, the term "guaranteed renewable" may be used only in a policy which 
the insured has the right to continue in force by the timely payment of premiums 
by the insured until fifty (50) years of age, or in the case of a policy issued 
to an insured who is older than forty-four (44) years of age, for at least five 
(5) years from its date of issue, during which period the insurer has no right 
to make unilaterally any change in any provision of the policy while the policy 
is in force, except that the insurer may make changes in premium rates by 
classes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The foregoing limitation on the use of the term 
"noncancelable" shall also apply to any synonymous term such as "guaranteed 
continuable".</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nothing contained in this subsection is intended to 
restrict the development of policies having other guarantees of renewability, or 
to prevent the accurate description of their terms of renewability or the 
classification of such policies as guaranteed renewable or noncancelable for any 
period during which they may actually be such, provided the terms used to 
describe them in policy contracts and advertising are not such as may readily be 
confused with the above terms.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Inapplicable or Inconsistent Provisions. If any 
provision of this section is in whole or in part inapplicable to or inconsistent 
with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy, the insurer, with the 
approval of the Insurance Commissioner, shall omit from such policy any 
inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall modify any inconsistent 
provision or part of the provision in such manner as to make the provision as 
contained in the policy consistent with the coverage provided by the 
policy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. Order of Certain Policy Provisions. The provisions 
which are the subject of subsections A and B of this section, or any 
corresponding provisions which are used in lieu thereof in accordance with such 
subsections, shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such 
subsections or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a 
unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be 
logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in 
part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a 
person to whom the policy is offered, delivered or issued.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Third Party Ownership. The word "insured", as used 
in this article, shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the 
insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning 
a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any 
indemnities, benefits and rights provided therein.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. Employer Designated as Beneficiary. No employer 
shall be designated or appointed as beneficiary of an employee or receive any 
benefits under an individual or group accident and health policy solely by 
reason of the employer-employee relationship; provided, however, this subsection 
shall not prevent the designation or appointment of an employer as beneficiary 
under a policy of accident and health insurance on any valuable or key employee 
of such employer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. Requirements of Other Jurisdictions. 1. Any policy 
of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for delivery to any 
person in this state, may contain any provision which is not less favorable to 
the insured or the beneficiary than the provisions of this article and which is 
prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is 
organized.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Any policy of a domestic insurer may, when issued 
for delivery in any other state or country, contain any provision permitted or 
required by the laws of such other state or country.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. Filing Procedure. The Insurance Commissioner may 
make such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the procedure for the 
filing or submission of policies subject to this article as are necessary, 
proper or advisable to the administration of this article. This provision shall 
not abridge any other authority granted the Insurance Commissioner by 
law.</FONT></P><B><I>
