<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. 1. The organization may retain from the first funds collected, the first ten percent (10%) of the purchase price of all contracts issued pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection B of this section. Thereafter, one hundred percent (100%) of all funds collected pursuant to the provisions of contracts for prepaid funeral benefits, except for outer enclosures as defined by the Funeral Services Licensing Act, shall be placed in investments authorized by Article 16 of the Insurance Code, except to the extent the Insurance Commissioner may determine that a particular asset may be inappropriate for investment for prepaid funeral benefits.</p>

<p>2. For outer enclosures at the option of the organization the first thirty-five percent (35%) of the retail price of the outer enclosures collected may be retained by the organization. The remaining sixty-five percent (65%) of the retail price collected for the outer enclosures shall be invested as otherwise provided by this subsection pursuant to the provisions of contracts for prepaid funeral benefits.</p>

<p>3. The funds required to be deposited pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection shall be deposited within ten (10) days after the collection of the funds and shall be held in a trust fund in this state for the use, benefit, and protection of purchasers of contracts for prepaid funeral benefits. Nothing contained within this section shall be construed to prohibit an organization authorized to accept prepaid funds from transferring the funds held in trust from one trust depository to another if notice of the transfer is given to the Insurance Commissioner within ten (10) days before the transfer and the organization transferring the funds remains the designated trustor. This subsection shall not affect funds invested prior to November 1, 1988.</p>

<p>B. An organization authorized to accept prepaid funds shall be authorized to provide purchasers with a choice of either of the following types of contracts:</p>

<p>1. A contract for Specific and Described Funeral Merchandise and Service at a Guaranteed Price. The provisions of this type of contract shall provide that interest paid by the organization upon monies deposited in trust shall be added to the principal and that principal and interest shall become available for disbursement to the organization upon the death of the beneficiary and if withdrawal of monies occurs prior to death, the net value, plus the amount withheld pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection A of this section, shall be paid to the purchaser. Net value of the contract for purposes of this section shall be determined by adding the amount of all principal paid in pursuant to the provisions of the contract plus all interest payable pursuant to subsection D of this section less taxes and administrative fees;</p>

<p>2. A contract establishing a fund for prepaid funeral benefits. The provisions of this type of contract shall require an initial minimum deposit of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) and shall grant the purchaser the right to add to the fund at the discretion of the purchaser. The provisions of this contract shall provide that the funds accumulated shall apply to the cost of the funeral services and merchandise selected and that any funds remaining unused shall be refunded to the purchaser or to the personal representative or designated beneficiary of the purchaser and if withdrawal of monies occurs prior to death, the organization may retain from the interest, all interest incurred in excess of the minimum amount payable pursuant to subsection D of this section less taxes and administrative fees. This type of contract shall also bear upon it the language: "Exact Funeral Merchandise and Services to be Selected at Time of Death";</p>

<p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, at no time shall the purchaser of a contract for Specific and Described Funeral Merchandise and Service at a Guaranteed Price receive upon any withdrawal or transfer a sum less than the original principal collected; or</p>

<p>4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, at no time shall the purchaser of a contract for Exact Funeral Merchandise and Services to be Selected at Time of Death receive upon any full withdrawal or transfer prior to death a sum less than the original principal collected available at death, with the exception of those accounts which bear principal reduced by previously made cash withdrawals.</p>

<p>C. If an organization other than the organization with which the purchaser contracted provides funeral merchandise and services upon the death of the beneficiary of the contract, the organization with whom the purchaser contracted shall forward, upon receipt of request in writing from the purchaser or the personal representative of the purchaser, the net value of the contract plus the amount withheld pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection A of this section to the organization which provided the merchandise and services or to the purchaser or the personal representative of the purchaser.</p>

<p>D. Funds deposited in trust pursuant to the provisions of either type of contract authorized by the provisions of this section shall earn for the account of the purchaser a rate of interest which is not less than the minimum rate of interest offered by the qualified investments specified in subsection A of this section to the savings customers of the qualified investments having interest-bearing accounts. The organization, in a nondiscriminatory manner, may pay or accrue interest for the accounts of purchasers at any rate greater than the minimum rate that the organization desires; provided, however, that the organization may retain from the interest all interest incurred in excess of the minimum amount payable pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p>E. A purchaser of either of the types of contracts authorized by the provisions of this section may withdraw the net value of the contract by signing a statement requesting the withdrawal. The organization shall retain in its files a copy of the statement requesting the withdrawal. Withdrawal of funds deposited pursuant to the provisions of a contract authorized by the provisions of paragraph 1 of subsection B of this section shall void the obligation of the contracting organization to provide funeral merchandise and services at a guaranteed price. Withdrawal forms shall be retained on file for at least six (6) years by the organization.</p>

<p>F. Following the death of a beneficiary for whom a contract has been purchased, the organization shall prepare a statement, acknowledged by the purchaser if the purchaser is not the beneficiary, or by the personal representative of the purchaser if the purchaser is the beneficiary, setting forth the use of the funds deposited and the party to whom any unused funds were disbursed. A copy of this statement shall remain in the files of the organization for at least six (6) years and a copy shall be delivered to the trust depository and the purchaser.</p>

<p>G. After thirty (30) days, a contract of either type authorized by the provisions of this section may become irrevocable and not subject to withdrawal prior to the death of the beneficiary if the purchaser signs an election making the contract irrevocable. This election shall not become effective until thirty (30) days after signing the original contract.</p>

<p>H. In no event shall more funds be withdrawn or paid pursuant to the provisions of one contract than were deposited with the organization and which were accumulated as interest. All funds deposited pursuant to the provisions of a contract authorized by the provisions of this section and deposited pursuant to the terms of this section and the interest earned on the funds shall be exempt from attachment, garnishment, execution, and the claims of creditors, receivers, or trustees in bankruptcy, until the time the funds have been withdrawn from the trust account and paid to the organization or refunded to the purchaser.</p>

<p>I. Each organization subject to the provisions of this section shall furnish a bond in the form of a cash bond, letter of credit, or fidelity bond, to be approved by the Insurance Commissioner, in the amount of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00) or fifteen percent (15%) of all funds collected for prepaid funeral benefits, whichever is less.</p>

<p>J. Organizations contracting with purchasers for prepaid funeral benefits pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection B of this section shall be entitled to deduct from the principal and interest allocable to the contracts an administrative fee which shall not exceed the product of .001146 times the total contract fund including accrued interest per month or any major portion thereof.</p>

<p>K. No organization holding a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=87382">Sections 6121</a> and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=435961">6124</a> of this title shall accept any funds except pursuant to the provisions of a contract for prepaid funeral or burial benefits authorized by the provisions of Sections 6121 through 6136.18 of this title, and no organization shall accept funds from a purchaser in excess of the contracted price of prepaid funeral or burial benefits purchased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>L. Any organization which knowingly commits any of the acts set forth in the first sentence of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=87382">Section 6121</a> of this title without first having obtained a permit to engage in the stated activity from the Insurance Commissioner, or any organization which commits the acts while knowingly operating with an invalid or expired permit, upon conviction, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each separate act performed without a valid permit shall be deemed a separate offense. The punishment upon conviction for the offense shall be a fine not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment in the county jail for not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one (1) year, or both such fine and imprisonment.</p>
