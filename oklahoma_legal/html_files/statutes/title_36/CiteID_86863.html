<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. A corporation organized pursuant to the provisions 
of Article 26 of the Insurance Code shall have power to indemnify any person who 
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending 
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative 
or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation, by 
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of 
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a 
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint 
venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, 
judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably 
incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted 
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to 
the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action 
or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The 
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, 
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of 
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a 
manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best 
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or 
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was 
unlawful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. A corporation organized pursuant to the provisions 
of Article 26 of the Insurance Code shall have the power to indemnify any person 
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, 
pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to 
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a 
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at 
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of 
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise 
against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by 
him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he 
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not 
opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no 
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to 
which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation 
unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was 
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of 
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is 
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court 
shall deem proper.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. To the extent that a director, officer, employee 
or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in 
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsection A or B of 
this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be 
indemnified against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably 
incurred by him in connection therewith.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Any indemnification under the provisions of 
subsection A or B of this section, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by 
the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination 
that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in 
the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set 
forth in subsection A or B of this section. Such determination shall be 
made:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. By the board of directors by a majority vote of a 
quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or 
proceeding; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if 
obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal 
counsel in a written opinion; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. By the members.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. Expenses incurred by an officer or director in 
defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the 
corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or 
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or 
officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not 
entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized by the provisions of 
this section. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so 
paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the board of directors deems 
appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. The indemnification and advancement of expenses 
provided by or granted pursuant to the other subsections of this section shall 
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking 
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, 
agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as 
to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while 
holding such office.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. A corporation shall have power to purchase and 
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, 
employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the 
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability 
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of 
his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to 
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this 
section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. For purposes of this section, references to "the 
corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any 
constituent corporation, including any constituent of a constituent, absorbed in 
a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would 
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees 
or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or 
agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of 
such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of 
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, 
shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this section with 
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect 
to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had 
continued.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. For purposes of this section, references to "other 
enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall 
include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee 
benefit plan, and references to "serving at the request of the corporation" 
shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the 
corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services, by such director, 
officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its 
participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a 
manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and 
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a 
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in 
this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. The indemnification and advancement of expenses 
provided by or granted pursuant to this section, unless otherwise provided when 
authorized or ratified, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a 
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the 
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.</FONT></P><B><I>
