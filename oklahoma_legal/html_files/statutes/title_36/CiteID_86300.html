<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. Every insurance company, copartnership, insurance association, interinsurance exchange, person, insurer, nonprofit hospital service and medical indemnity corporation, or health maintenance organization doing business in this state in the execution or exchange of contracts of insurance, indemnity or health maintenance services, or as an insurance company of any nature or character whatsoever, hereinafter referred to in this article as an insurance company or company, shall annually, on or before the first day of March, report under oath of the president or secretary or other chief officer of such company to the Insurance Commissioner the total amount of direct written premiums, membership, application, policy and/or registration fees charged during the preceding calendar year, or since the last return of such direct written premiums, membership, application, policy and/or registration fees was made by such company, from insurance of every kind upon persons or on the lives of persons resident in this state, or upon real and personal property located within this state, and/or upon any other risks insured within this state; provided, that with respect to the tax payable annually, considerations received for annuity contracts and payments received by a health maintenance organization from the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to a contract issued under the provisions of 42 U.S.C., Section 1395mm(g) shall no longer be deemed to be premiums for insurance and shall no longer be subject to the tax imposed by this section. Every such company shall, at the same time, pay to the Insurance Commissioner:</p>

<p>1. An annual license fee as prescribed by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440289">Section 321</a> of this title; and</p>

<p>2. An annual tax on all of the direct written premiums after all returned premiums are deducted, and on all membership, application, policy and/or registration fees, installment and/or finance fees or charges collected thereby, for the privileges of having written, continued and/or serviced insurance on lives, property and/or other risks in this state and of having made and serviced investments therein during the then expiring license year except premiums or fees paid by any county, city, town or school district funds or by their duly constituted authorities performing a public service organized pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=102553">Sections 1001</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=102560">1008 of Title 74</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, or <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438402">Sections 176</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=85818">180.4 of Title 60</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. Provided, no deduction shall be made from premiums for dividends paid to policyholders. Except as set forth in this paragraph, the rate of taxation for all entities subject to the tax shall be two and twenty-five one-hundredths percent (2.25%). If any insurance company or other entity liable for the taxes levied pursuant to the provisions of this section fails to remit such taxes in a timely manner, it shall remain liable therefor together with interest thereon at an annual rate equal to the average United States Treasury Bill rate of the preceding calendar year as certified by the State Treasurer on the first regular business day in January of each year, plus four percentage points.</p>

<p>a. The rate of taxation for all life insurance policies insuring the life of an employee or director for the benefit of the employer or a trust sponsored by the employer, which is purchased by the employer or trust sponsored by the employer for the benefit of its employees, shall be computed for each policy at the rate of:</p>

<p>(1) two and twenty-five one-hundredths percent (2.25%) of policy year premium up to One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), and</p>

<p>(2) one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of policy year premium exceeding One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00).</p>

<p>b. Premiums on which taxes are paid under division (2) of subparagraph a of this paragraph are not subject to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=86307">Section 628</a> of this title. The Commissioner shall promulgate rules regarding the sale of life insurance policies subject to division (2) of subparagraph a of this paragraph.</p>

<p>c. Proceeds from the premium tax collected under this paragraph from contracted entities under the Ensuring Access to Medicaid Act shall be deposited in the Medicaid Health Improvement Revolving Fund created in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=492332">Section 1010.8A of Title 56</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the premium taxes to be deposited in the Medicaid Health Improvement Revolving Fund for the calendar year ending December 31, 2024, and for each calendar year thereafter, shall not be subject to the apportionments provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=86232">Section 312.1</a> of this title.</p>

<p>B. For all insurance companies or other entities taxed pursuant to this section, the annual license fee and tax and all required membership, application, policy, registration, and agent appointment fees shall be in lieu of all other state taxes or fees, except those taxes and fees provided for in the Oklahoma Insurance Code, and the taxes and fees of any subdivision or municipality of the state, except ad valorem taxes and the tax required to be paid pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=93325">Section 50001 of Title 68</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. Provided, such license fee, tax and membership, application, policy, registration, and appointment fees shall be in lieu of any and all ad valorem taxes levied on intangible personal property. Any company, except health maintenance organizations, failing to make such returns and payments promptly and correctly shall forfeit and pay to the Insurance Commissioner, in addition to the amount of the taxes and fees and interest, the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the unpaid amount, whichever is greater; and the company so failing or neglecting for sixty (60) days shall thereafter be debarred from transacting any business of insurance in this state until the taxes, fees and penalties are fully paid, and the Insurance Commissioner shall revoke the license or certificate of authority granted to the agent or agents of that company to transact business in this state. Provided, that when any such insurance company, copartnership, insurance association, interinsurance exchange, person, insurer, or nonprofit hospital service and indemnity corporation applies for the first time for a license to do business in this state, it shall, at the time of making such application, pay a license fee as prescribed by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=365224">Section 1435.23</a> of this title, and, on or before the first day of March, following, pay the premium tax, membership, application, policy, registration, and agent appointment fees, as hereinbefore provided. Such license fee, tax and membership, application, policy, registration, and appointment fees shall be in lieu of all other state taxes or fees, except those taxes and fees provided for in the Oklahoma Insurance Code, and the taxes and fees of any subdivision or municipality of the state, except ad valorem taxes and the tax required to be paid pursuant to Section 50001 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>C. Any health maintenance organization failing to file premium tax returns and payments promptly and correctly shall forfeit and pay to the Insurance Commissioner, in addition to the amount of the taxes, the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the unpaid amount, whichever is greater. Any health maintenance organization failing or neglecting to pay the tax and penalty shall be debarred from operating in this state and the Insurance Commissioner shall revoke the license of the health maintenance organization, until such taxes and penalties are fully paid.</p>
