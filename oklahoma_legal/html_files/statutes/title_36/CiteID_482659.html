<p>2. &nbsp;The petition shall include:</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;The court may approve the requested transfer and novation of the subject business, with effectiveness of all or part of the implementation deferred until the assuming insurer can satisfy the requirements pursuant to subsection D of this section.</p>

<p>F. &nbsp;Rules.</p>
