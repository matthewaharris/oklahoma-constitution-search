</div>
<p>A. &nbsp;If the Administrator finds that the order is in the public interest and subsection D of this section authorizes the action, an order issued under this act may deny an application, or may condition or limit registration:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;Of an applicant to be a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative; and</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;If the applicant is a broker-dealer or investment adviser, any partner, officer, or director, any person having a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the broker-dealer or investment adviser.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;If the Administrator finds that the order issued is in the public interest and subsection D of this section authorizes the action an order issued under this act may revoke, suspend, condition, or limit the registration of a registrant and if the registrant is a broker-dealer or investment adviser, any partner, officer, or director, any person having a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the broker-dealer or investment adviser. &nbsp;However, the Administrator:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;May not institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under this subsection based on an order issued by another state that is reported to the Administrator or designee later than one year after the date of the order on which it is based; and</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;Under subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 5 of subsection D of this section may not issue an order on the basis of an order under the state securities act of another state unless the other order was based on conduct for which subsection D of this section would authorize the action had the conduct occurred in this state.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;If the Administrator finds that the order is in the public interest and paragraphs 1 through 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 or 13 of subsection D of this section authorizes the action, an order under this act may censure, impose a bar, impose a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed a maximum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for a single violation or Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) for multiple violations on a registrant, and/or recover the costs of the investigation from a registrant and if the registrant is a broker-dealer or investment adviser, from any partner, officer, or director, any person having a similar function or any person directly or indirectly controlling the broker-dealer or investment adviser.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;A person may be disciplined under subsections A through C of this section if the person:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;Has filed an application for registration in this state under this act within the previous ten (10) years, which, as of the effective date of registration or as of any date after filing in the case of an order denying effectiveness, was incomplete in any material respect or contained a statement that, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, was false or misleading with respect to a material fact;</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;Has willfully violated or willfully failed to comply with this act&nbsp;or a rule adopted or order issued under this act&nbsp;within the previous ten (10) years;</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;Has been convicted of any felony or within the previous ten (10) years has been convicted of a misdemeanor involving a security, a commodity futures or option contract, or an aspect of a business involving securities, commodities, investments, franchises, insurance, banking, or finance;</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;Is enjoined or restrained by a court of competent jurisdiction in an action instituted by the Administrator under this act &nbsp;, a state, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the United States from engaging in or continuing an act, practice, or course of business involving an aspect of a business involving securities, commodities, investments, franchises, insurance, banking, or finance;</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;Is the subject of an order, issued after notice and opportunity for hearing by:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;the securities, depository institution, insurance or other financial services regulator of a state, or by the Securities and Exchange Commission or other federal agency denying, revoking, barring, or suspending registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, federal covered investment adviser, or investment adviser representative,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;the securities regulator of a state or by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, investment adviser representative, or federal covered investment adviser,</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;the Securities and Exchange Commission or by a self-regulatory organization suspending, barring, canceling or expelling the registrant from membership in a self-regulatory organization,</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;a court adjudicating a United States Postal Service fraud,</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;the insurance regulator of a state denying, suspending, or revoking the registration of an insurance agent, or</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;a depository institution regulator suspending or barring a person from the banking or depository institution business;</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;Is the subject of an adjudication or determination, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, a federal depository institution regulator, or a depository institution, insurance, or other financial services regulator of a state that the person willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Commodity Exchange Act, the securities or commodities law of a state, or a federal or state law under which a business involving investments, franchises, insurance, banking, or finance is regulated;</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;Is insolvent, either because the persons liabilities exceed the persons assets or because the person cannot meet the persons obligations as they mature, but the Administrator may not enter an order against an applicant or registrant under this paragraph without a finding of insolvency as to the applicant or registrant;</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;Refuses to allow or otherwise impedes the Administrator from conducting an audit or inspection under subsection D of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=437174">Section&nbsp;1-410</a> of this&nbsp;title or refuses access to any registrants office to conduct an audit or inspection under subsection D of Section 1-410 of this&nbsp;title;</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;Has failed to reasonably supervise an agent, investment adviser representative, or other individual, if the agent, investment adviser representative, or other individual was subject to the persons supervision and committed a violation of this act&nbsp;or a rule adopted or order issued under this act&nbsp;within the previous ten (10) years;</p>

<p>10. &nbsp;Has not paid the proper filing fee within thirty (30) days after having been notified by the Administrator of a deficiency, but the Administrator shall vacate an order under this paragraph when the deficiency is corrected;</p>

<p>11. &nbsp;After notice and opportunity for a hearing, has been found within the previous ten (10) years:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;by a court of competent jurisdiction to have willfully violated the laws of a foreign jurisdiction under which the business of securities, commodities, investment, franchises, insurance, banking or finance is regulated,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;to have been the subject of an order of a securities regulator of a foreign jurisdiction denying, revoking, or suspending the right to engage in the business of securities as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, investment adviser representative or similar person, or</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;to have been suspended or expelled from membership by or participation in a securities exchange or securities association operating under the securities laws of a foreign jurisdiction;</p>

<p>12. &nbsp;Is the subject of a cease and desist order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission or issued under the securities, commodities, investment, franchise, banking, finance or insurance laws of a state;</p>

<p>13. &nbsp;Has engaged in dishonest or unethical practices in the securities, commodities, investment, franchise, banking, finance or insurance business within the previous ten (10) years; or</p>

<p>14. &nbsp;Is not qualified on the basis of factors such as training, experience, and knowledge of the securities business. &nbsp;However, in the case of an application by an agent for a broker-dealer that is a member of a self-regulatory organization or by an individual for registration as an investment adviser representative, a denial order may not be based on this paragraph if the individual has successfully completed all examinations required by subsection E of this section. &nbsp;The Administrator may require an applicant for registration under <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=437166">Section&nbsp;1-402</a> or&nbsp;<a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=437168">1-404</a> of this&nbsp;title who has not been registered in a state within the two (2) years preceding the filing of an application in this state to successfully complete an examination.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;A rule adopted or order issued under this act may require that an examination, including an examination developed or approved by an organization of securities regulators, be successfully completed by a class of individuals or all individuals. &nbsp;An order issued under this act may waive, in whole or in part, an examination as to an individual and a rule adopted under this act may waive, in whole or in part, an examination as to a class of individuals if the Administrator determines that the examination is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors.</p>

<p>F. &nbsp;The Administrator may summarily postpone an application or summarily suspend a registration before final determination of an administrative proceeding. &nbsp;Upon the issuance of the order, the Administrator shall promptly notify each person subject to the order that the order has been issued, the reasons for the action, and that within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of a request in a record from the person the matter will be scheduled for a hearing and such hearing shall be commenced within fifteen (15) days of the matter being set for hearing. &nbsp;If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the Administrator, within thirty (30) days after the date of service of the order, the order becomes final by operation of law. &nbsp;If a hearing is requested or ordered, the Administrator, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend the order until final determination.</p>

<p>G. &nbsp;An order may not be issued under this section, except under subsection F of this section, without:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;Appropriate notice to the applicant or registrant;</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;Opportunity for hearing; and</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;Findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. &nbsp;If the person to whom the notice is addressed does not request a hearing within&nbsp;thirty (30) days after the date of service of the notice &nbsp;, a final order as provided in subsection A, B or C of this section may be issued.</p>

<p>H. &nbsp;A person who controls, directly or indirectly, a person not in compliance with this section may be disciplined by order of the Administrator under subsections A through C of this section to the same extent as the noncomplying person, unless the controlling person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct that is the basis for discipline under this section.</p>

<p>I. &nbsp;The Administrator may not institute a proceeding under subsection A, B or C of this section based solely on material facts actually known by the Administrator unless an investigation or the proceeding is instituted within one year after the Administrator actually knew the material facts.</p>
