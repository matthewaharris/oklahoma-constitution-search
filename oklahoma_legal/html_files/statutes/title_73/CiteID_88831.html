<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The Authority is hereby authorized to acquire 
land for and to erect, equip, operate and maintain a building or buildings for 
the use of state and/or federal agencies and departments at any place or 
location within the State of Oklahoma, the place of erection to be selected by 
the Authority. Provided, however, that the place of erection to be selected by 
the Authority within the Capitol Improvement and Zoning District as defined by 
law and approved by the Capitol Improvement and Zoning Commission shall be in 
compliance with statutory designations as may be provided in this article. 
Provided further that in fulfilling the purpose of this act in acquiring land 
for the erection, equipping, operation and maintenance of any facilities, 
building or buildings at a location other than within the Capitol Improvement 
and Zoning District the Authority is hereby specifically empowered 
to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) For the purpose of paying the costs thereof the 
Authority is hereby authorized to borrow money on the credit of the income and 
revenues to be derived from the operation of said building and, in anticipation 
of the collection of such income and revenues, to issue negotiable bonds as may, 
in the opinion of the Authority, be necessary for such purposes, and to provide 
for the payment of such bonds and the rights of the holders thereof, as 
hereinafter provided. Said bonds may be issued in one or more series, may be 
sold in such manner and at such price or prices, may bear such date or dates, 
may mature at such time or times, not to exceed thirty (30) years from their 
date, may be in such denomination or denominations, may be in such form either 
coupon or registered, may carry such registration or conversion privileges, may 
be executed in such manner, may be payable in such medium of payments, at such 
place or places, may be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without 
premium, and may bear such rate or rates of interest not in excess of seven and 
one-half percent (7 1/2%) per annum, and shall be subject to such call for 
redemption as may be provided by resolution or resolutions to be adopted by the 
Authority. Such bonds shall have all of the qualities and incidents of 
negotiable paper; and the bonds and the interest earned on said bonds shall not 
be subject to taxation by the State of Oklahoma, or by any county, municipality 
or political subdivision therein.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) The Authority may issue bonds hereunder for the 
purpose of refunding any obligation of the Authority payable from the revenues 
of said building, or may authorize and deliver a single issue of bonds hereunder 
for the purpose in part of refunding obligations of the Authority payable from 
the revenues derived from said building and in part for the making, equipping 
and furnishing of additions, improvements and extensions thereto or for an 
additional building or buildings. Where bonds are issued under this paragraph 
solely for refunding purposes, such bonds may either be sold as above provided 
or delivered in exchange for the outstanding obligations. If sold, the proceeds 
may be either applied to the payment of the obligations refunded or deposited in 
escrow for the retirement thereof. Nothing herein contained shall be construed 
to authorize the refunding of any outstanding obligations which are not either 
maturing, callable for redemption under their terms, or voluntarily surrendered 
by their holders for cancellation, unless the Authority covenants that 
sufficient funds to pay all remaining interest and principal payments of the 
outstanding obligations when due will be placed in escrow for such purpose at 
the place or places where said bonds are payable. All bonds issued under this 
paragraph shall in all respects be authorized, issued and secured in the manner 
provided for other bonds issued under this act, and shall have all the 
attributes of such bonds. The Authority may provide any such refunding bonds 
shall have the same priority of lien on the revenues pledged for their payment 
as was enjoyed by the obligations refunded thereby.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) The bonds issued hereunder shall not be an 
indebtedness of the State of Oklahoma or of the Authority herein, but shall be 
special obligations payable solely from the rents and revenues to be derived 
from the operation of the building, and the Authority is authorized and directed 
to pledge all or any part of such revenues to the payment of principal and 
interest on the bonds, the operation and maintenance of the building, and to 
create a reserve for such purposes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) The State Treasurer of the State of Oklahoma is 
hereby authorized to purchase from the Authority at private sale all or any part 
of said bonds, or interim bonds, as an investment of the public monies in his 
possession. It shall be the responsibility of the State Treasurer to invest only 
that portion of such public monies as it deems to be more than sufficient to 
meet current expenditures payable from public monies. The State Treasurer is 
authorized to buy and the Authority is authorized and required to sell to the 
State Treasurer at private sale, as provided in this section, so many of the 
bonds authorized by this act as may be safely purchased for investment of public 
monies by the State Treasurer without handicapping the State of Oklahoma in 
promptly meeting its obligations. In the event of such sale or sales, the 
Authority shall determine and fix the rate of interest the bonds so sold shall 
bear.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(5) In the event any or all of the bonds are sold to 
the State Treasurer under the provisions of subparagraph (4) hereof and 
thereafter the uninvested cash on hand and in solvent banks falls short of 
demand orders on the State Treasury, it shall be the duty of the State Treasurer 
to sell such part or all of the bonds as are necessary to be converted into cash 
to meet such demands.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) For the purpose of paying the costs thereof the 
Authority is hereby authorized to borrow money on the credit of the income and 
revenues to be derived from the operation of said building and, in anticipation 
of the collection of such income and revenues, to issue negotiable bonds not to 
exceed the sum of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) as may, in the opinion of 
the Authority, be necessary for such purposes, and is authorized to provide for 
the payment of such bonds and the rights of the holders thereof, as hereinafter 
provided. Said bonds may be issued in one or more series, may be sold in such 
manner and at such price or prices, may bear such date or dates, may mature at 
such time or times, not to exceed thirty (30) years from their date, may be in 
such denomination or denominations, may be in such form either coupon or 
registered, may carry such registration or conversion privileges, may be 
executed in such manner, may be payable in such medium of payments, at such 
place or places, may be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without 
premium, and may bear such rate or rates of interest, not exceeding four percent 
(4%) per annum, as may be provided by resolution or resolutions to be adopted by 
the Authority. Such bonds shall have all of the qualities and incidents of 
negotiable paper, and shall not be subject to taxation by the State of Oklahoma, 
or by any county, municipality or political subdivision therein. All bonds 
maturing after ten (10) years from their dates shall be subject to call and 
redemption, in inverse order of maturity and bond numbers, at par and accrued 
interest, the detailed provisions for such call and redemption to be fixed by 
the Authority in the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of said 
bonds.</FONT></P>
