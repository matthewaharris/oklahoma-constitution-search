of need, at such time and in such manner as required by the Department, shall 
file:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. A disclosure statement with their applications 
unless the applicant is a publicly held company required to file periodic

the new or any long-term care service acquisition, expansion, or establishment 
of a new facility.</FONT></P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. Except as provided by Section 1-853.1 of this 
title, the investigation made pursuant to an application for a certificate of 
need shall include the following:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The availability of long-term care which may serve 
as alternatives or substitutes;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The adequacy of financial resources for the

care facility;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The record of the applicant's current and prior

any other state. The investigation of such record shall include, but not be

Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, and the state licensure and certification agency; 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Review of minutes of family councils and residents 
councils, and the facilities' responses, from each of the applicant's holdings 
in Oklahoma; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Any other matter which the Department deems 
appropriate.</FONT></P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. Before making a final determination on an 
acquisition application, the Commissioner shall cause paid public notices to be 
published in a newspaper of general circulation near the facility and in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the area where the application is available 
for public inspection. A notice in a form prescribed by the Department also 
shall be posted by the applicant in a public area in each facility operated by 
the applicant in Oklahoma, to inform residents and families of the applicant's 
proposed action. The public notices shall offer participating parties an 
opportunity to submit written comments.</FONT></P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. The Commissioner's decision to approve or deny the 
proposed acquisition, expansion, or establishment of a new facility shall be 
made within forty-five (45) days following the deadline for submitting written 
comments, or the proposed acquisition or establishment shall be automatically 
approved, unless otherwise prohibited pursuant to the provisions of the 
Long-term Care Certificate of Need Act.</FONT></P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. If the Commissioner finds that a proposed 
acquisition, expansion, or establishment of a new facility is consistent with 
the criteria and standards for review of such projects, and is otherwise in 
compliance with the provision of the Long-term Care Certificate of Need Act, 
then the Commissioner shall issue a certificate of need. If the Commissioner 
finds that the proposed acquisition, expansion, or establishment of a new 
facility is not consistent with the criteria and standards, or is otherwise not 
in compliance with the provisions of the Long-term Care Certificate of Need Act, 
the Commissioner shall deny the certificate of need.</FONT></P>
