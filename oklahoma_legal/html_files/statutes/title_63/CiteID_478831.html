<p>8. &nbsp;Section F of the form, which shall have the heading, in bold, Information for Patient or Representative of Patient Named on this Form, shall include the following language, appearing in bold on the form:</p>

<p>The POLST form is always voluntary and is usually for persons with advanced illness. &nbsp;Before providing information for or signing it, carefully read Information for Patients and Their Families - Your Medical Treatment Rights Under Oklahoma Law, which the health care provider must give you. &nbsp;It is especially important to read the sections on CPR and food and fluids, which have summaries of Oklahoma laws that may control the directions you may give. &nbsp;POLST records your wishes for medical treatment in your current state of health. &nbsp;Once initial medical treatment is begun and the risks and benefits of further therapy are clear, your treatment wishes may change. &nbsp;Your medical care and this form can be changed to reflect your new wishes at any time. &nbsp;However, no form can address all the medical treatment decisions that may need to be made. &nbsp;An advance health care directive is recommended, regardless of your health status. &nbsp;An advance directive allows you to document in detail your future health care instructions and/or name a health care agent to speak for you if you are unable to speak for yourself.</p>

<p>The State of Oklahoma affirms that the lives of all are of equal dignity regardless of age or disability and emphasizes that no one should ever feel pressured to agree to forego life-preserving medical treatment because of age, disability or fear of being regarded as a burden.</p>

<p>If this form is for a minor for whom you are authorized to make health care decisions, you may not direct denial of medical treatment in a manner that would violate the child abuse and neglect laws of Oklahoma. &nbsp;In particular, you may not direct the withholding of medically indicated treatment from a disabled infant with life-threatening conditions, as those terms are defined in 42 U.S.C., Section 5106g or regulations implementing it and 42 U.S.C., Section 5106a.</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;Section G of the form, which shall have the heading, in bold, Directions for Completing and Implementing Form, shall include the following three subdivisions:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;the first subdivision, entitled COMPLETING POLST, shall have the following language with the words, The signature of the patient or the patients representative is required appearing in bold on the form:</p>

<p>POLST must be reviewed and prepared in consultation with the patient or the patients representative after that person has been given a copy of Information for Patients and Their Families - Your Medical Treatment Rights Under Oklahoma Law. &nbsp;POLST must be reviewed and signed by a physician to be valid. &nbsp;Be sure to document the basis for concluding the patient had or lacked capacity at the time of execution of the form in the patients medical record. &nbsp;If the patient lacks capacity, any current advance directive form must be reviewed and the patients representative and physician must both certify that POLST complies with it. &nbsp;The signature of the patient or the patients representative is required; however, if the patients representative is not reasonably available to sign the original form, a copy of the completed form with the signature of the patients representative must be placed in the medical record as soon as practicable and on file must be written on the appropriate signature line on this form.,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;the second subdivision, entitled IMPLEMENTING POLST, shall have the following language:</p>

<p>If a minor protests a directive to deny the minor life-preserving medical treatment, the denial of treatment may not be implemented pending issuance of a judicial order resolving the conflict. &nbsp;A health care provider unwilling to comply with POLST must comply with the transfer and treatment pending transfer requirements of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=100309">Section 3101.9 of Title 63</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes as well as those of the Nondiscrimination in Treatment Act, <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=470749">Sections 3090.2</a> and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=470750">3090.3 of Title 63</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, and</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;the third subdivision, entitled REVIEWING POLST, shall have the following language:</p>

<p>This POLST must be reviewed at least annually or earlier if:</p>

<p>The patient is admitted to or discharged from a medical care facility; there is substantial change in the patients health status; or the treatment preferences of the patient or patients representative change.</p>

<p>The same requirements for participation of the patient or patients representative, and signature by both a physician and the patient or the patients representative, that are described under COMPLETING POLST shall also apply when POLST is reviewed, and must be documented in Section I.</p>

<p>10. &nbsp;Section H of the form, which shall have the heading, in bold, REVOCATION OF POLST, shall have the following language, with the words specified below appearing in bold on the form:</p>

<p>If POLST is revised or becomes invalid, write in bold the word VOID in large letters on the front of the form. &nbsp;After voiding the form a new form may be completed. &nbsp;A patient with capacity or the individual or individuals authorized to sign on behalf of the patient in Section E of this form may void this form. &nbsp;If no new form is completed, full treatment and resuscitation is to be provided, except as otherwise authorized by Oklahoma law.</p>

<p>11. &nbsp;Section I of the form, which shall have the heading, in bold, REVIEW SECTION, followed by: Periodic review confirms current form or may require completion of new form, shall include the following columns and a number of rows determined by the Office of the Attorney General:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;Date of Review,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;Location of Review,</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;Patient or Representative Signature,</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;Physician Signature, and</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;Outcome of Review.</p>

<p>Each row in column (5) shall include a checkbox followed by, FORM CONFIRMED - No Change, below which there shall be a checkbox followed by, FORM VOIDED, see updated form., below which there shall be a checkbox followed by, FORM VOIDED, no new form.</p>

<p>A final section of the form, which shall have the heading, in bold, Contact Information:, shall include two rows of four columns. &nbsp;In the first column, the first row shall include Patient/Representative followed by an adequate space for such information, and the second column shall include Health Care Professional Preparing Form followed by an adequate space for such information. &nbsp;In the second column both rows shall include Relationship followed by an adequate space for such information; in the third column both rows shall include Phone Number followed by an adequate space for such information; and in the fourth column both rows shall include Email Address followed by an adequate space for such information.</p>
