<P>A. Only a licensed medical doctor, licensed osteopathic physician, licensed 
chiropractic physician, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or 
physician's assistant, certified by the State Board of Medical Licensure and 
Supervision, the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners or Board of Chiropractic 
Examiners; an employee of a hospital or other health care facility authorized by 
the hospital or health care facility to withdraw blood; or other qualified 
person authorized by the Board of Tests for Alcohol and Drug Influence acting at 
the request of a law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for purpose of 
having a determination made of its concentration of alcohol or the presence or 
concentration of other intoxicating substance. Only qualified persons authorized 
by the Board of Tests for Alcohol and Drug Influence may collect breath, saliva 
or urine, or administer tests of breath under the provisions of this 
section.</P>
<P>B. If the person authorized to withdraw blood as specified in subsection A of 
this section is presented with a written statement:</P>
<P>1. Authorizing blood withdrawal signed by the person whose blood is to be 
withdrawn;</P>
<P>2. Signed by a duly authorized peace officer that the person whose blood is 
to be withdrawn has agreed to the withdrawal of blood;</P>
<P>3. Signed by a duly authorized peace officer that the person whose blood is 
to be withdrawn has been placed under arrest and that the officer has probable 
cause to believe that the person, while intoxicated, has operated a vessel in 
such manner as to have caused the death or serious physical injury of another 
person, or the person has been involved in a boating collision and has been 
removed from the scene of the collision that resulted in the death or great 
bodily injury of any person, as defined in subsection B of Section 646 of Title 
21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, to a hospital or other health care facility outside 
the State of Oklahoma before the law enforcement officer was able to effect an 
arrest for such offense; or</P>
<P>4. In the form of an order from a district court that blood be withdrawn, the 
person authorized to withdraw the blood and the hospital or other health care 
facility where the withdrawal occurs may rely on such a statement or order as 
evidence that the person has consented to or has been required to submit to the 
clinical procedure and shall not require the person to sign any additional 
consent or waiver form. In such a case, the person authorized to perform the 
procedure, the employer of such person, and the hospital or other health care 
facility shall not be liable in any action alleging lack of consent or lack of 
informed consent.</P>
<P>C. No person specified in subsection A of this section, no employer of such a 
person, and no hospital or other health care facility where blood is withdrawn 
shall incur any civil or criminal liability as a result of the proper withdrawal 
of blood when acting at the request of a law enforcement officer by the 
provisions of Section 3 or 5 of this act, or when acting in reliance upon a 
signed statement or court order as provided in this section, if the act is 
performed in a reasonable manner according to generally accepted clinical 
practice. No person specified in subsection A of this section shall incur any 
civil or criminal liability as a result of the proper collection of breath, 
saliva or urine when acting at the request of a law enforcement officer under 
the provisions of Section 3 or 5 of this act or when acting pursuant to a court 
order.</P>
<P>D. The blood, breath, saliva or urine specimens obtained shall be tested by 
the appropriate test as determined by the Board of Tests for Alcohol and Drug 
Influence, or tested by a laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules 
pursuant to Section 759 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes, to determine the 
alcohol concentration thereof, or the presence and concentration of any other 
intoxicating substance which might have affected the ability of the person 
tested to operate a vessel safely.</P>
<P>E. When blood is withdrawn or saliva or urine is collected for testing of its 
alcohol concentration or other intoxicating substance presence or concentration, 
at the request of a law enforcement officer, a sufficient quantity of the same 
specimen shall be obtained to enable the tested person, at his or her own option 
and expense, to have an independent analysis made of such specimen. The excess 
blood, saliva or urine specimen shall be retained by a laboratory approved by 
the Board of Tests for Alcohol and Drug Influence, in accordance with the rules 
and regulations of the Board, or by a laboratory that is exempt from the Board 
rules pursuant to Section 759 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes, for sixty 
(60) days from the date of collection. At any time within that period, the 
tested person or his or her attorney may direct that such blood, saliva or urine 
specimen be sent or delivered to a laboratory of his or her own choosing and 
approved by the Board for an independent analysis. Neither the tested person, 
nor any agent of such person, shall have access to the additional blood, saliva 
or urine specimen prior to the completion of the independent analysis, except 
the analyst performing the independent analysis and agents of the analyst.</P>
<P>F. When a test of breath is performed for the purpose of determining the 
alcohol concentration thereof, except when such test is performed by means of an 
automated analyzer as designated by the Board of Tests for Alcohol and Drug 
Influence, a sufficient quantity of breath, or of the alcohol content of a fixed 
or measured quantity of breath, shall be obtained, in accordance with the rules 
and regulations of the Board to enable the tested person, at his or her own 
option and expense, to have an independent analysis made of such specimen. The 
excess specimen of breath, or of its alcohol content, shall be retained by the 
law enforcement agency employing the arresting officer, in accordance with the 
rules and regulations of the Board, for sixty (60) days from the date of 
collection. At any time within that period, the tested person, or his or her 
attorney, may direct that such specimen be sent or delivered to a laboratory of 
his or her own choosing and approved by the Board for an independent analysis. 
Neither the tested person, nor any agent of such person, shall have access to 
the additional specimen of breath, or of its alcohol content, prior to the 
completion of the independent analysis thereof, except the analyst performing 
the independent analysis and agents of the analyst.</P>
<P>G. The costs of collecting blood, breath, saliva or urine specimens for the 
purpose of determining the alcohol or other intoxicating substance thereof, by 
or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, shall be borne by the law 
enforcement agency employing such officer. The cost of collecting, retaining and 
sending or delivering to an independent laboratory the excess specimens of 
blood, breath, saliva or urine for independent analysis at the option of the 
tested person shall also be borne by such law enforcement agency. The cost of 
the independent analysis of such specimen of blood, breath, saliva or urine 
shall be borne by the tested person at whose option such analysis is performed. 
The tested person, or his or her agent, shall make all necessary arrangements 
for the performance of such independent analysis other than the forwarding or 
delivery of such specimen.</P>
<P>H. Tests of blood or breath for the purpose of determining the alcohol 
concentration thereof, and tests of blood, saliva or urine for the purpose of 
determining the presence or concentration of any other intoxicating substance 
therein, under the provisions of this section, whether administered by or at the 
direction of a law enforcement officer or administered independently, at the 
option of the tested person, on the excess specimen of such person's blood, 
breath, saliva or urine, to be considered valid and admissible in evidence under 
the provisions of this section, shall have been administered or performed in 
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board of Tests for Alcohol and 
Drug Influence, or performed by a laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules 
pursuant to Section 759 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P>I. Any person who has been arrested for any offense arising out of acts 
alleged to have been committed while the person was operating or in actual 
physical control of a vessel while under the influence of alcohol, any other 
intoxicating substance or the combined influence of alcohol and any other 
intoxicating substance, who is not requested by a law enforcement officer to 
submit to a test, shall be entitled to have an independent test of his or her 
blood, breath, saliva or urine, which is appropriate as determined by the Board 
of Tests for Alcohol and Drug Influence for the purpose of determining its 
alcohol concentration or the presence or concentration of any other intoxicating 
substance therein, performed by a person of his or her own choosing who is 
qualified as stipulated in this section. The arrested person shall bear the 
responsibility for making all necessary arrangements for the administration of 
such independent test and for the independent analysis of any specimens 
obtained, and bear all costs thereof. The failure or inability of the arrested 
person to obtain an independent test shall not preclude the admission of other 
competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether such person was under 
the influence of alcohol, or any other intoxicating substance or the combined 
influence of alcohol and any other intoxicating substance.</P>
<P>J. Any agency or laboratory certified by the Board of Tests for Alcohol and 
Drug Influence or any agency or laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules 
pursuant to Section 759 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes, which analyzes 
breath, blood, or urine shall make available a written report of the results of 
the test administered by or at the direction of the law enforcement officer 
to:</P>
<P>1. The tested person, or his or her attorney;</P>
<P>2. The Commissioner of Public Safety; and</P>
<P>3. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) analyst of the state, upon 
request.</P>
<P>The results of the tests provided for in this section shall be admissible in 
civil actions.</P>
