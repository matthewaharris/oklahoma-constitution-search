</div>
<p>A. The application required for the initial and subsequent registration of a vessel or a motor shall be accompanied by payment of the following fees:</p>

<p>1. Where the manufacturer's factory delivered price, or in the absence of such price being published in a recognized publication for the use of marine dealers and/or for purposes of insurance and financing firms, where the provable original or new cost of all materials, is One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) or less, the registration and license fee for the first and for each succeeding year's registration shall be One Dollar ($1.00);</p>

<p>2. Where the manufacturer's factory delivered price, or in the absence of such price being published as provided in paragraph 1 of this section, where the value of such vessel or motor is determined and fixed as above required and, is in excess of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00), there shall be added to the fee of One Dollar ($1.00), the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) for each One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) or any fraction thereof, in excess of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) provided such fee shall not exceed One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00);</p>

<p>3. After the first year's registration in this state under the Oklahoma Vessel and Motor Registration Act of any new vessel or new motor under paragraph 2 of this subsection, the registration for the second year shall be ninety percent (90%) of the fee computed and assessed hereunder for the first year, and thereafter, such fee shall be computed and assessed at ninety percent (90%) of the previous year's fee and shall be so computed and assessed for the next nine (9) successive years provided such fee shall not exceed One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00);</p>

<p>4. The initial and subsequent registration fee for any vessel which is a part of a fleet used for lodging and for which a rental fee and sales tax are collected shall be Forty Dollars ($40.00) in lieu of the fees required by paragraphs 1 through 3 of this subsection. For the purpose of this paragraph, "fleet" means twenty or more vessels operated by a business organization from a single anchorage. The fee provided for in this paragraph may be reduced annually to zero until the total reduction equals the difference between the sum of the fees paid pursuant to paragraphs 1 through 3 of this subsection for the two registration years preceding January 1, 1990, and the fee provided for in this paragraph;</p>

<p>5. For any vessel or motor owned and numbered, registered or licensed prior to January 1, 1990, in this or any other state, or in the absence of such registration upon proof of the year, model and age of same, the registration fee shall be computed and assessed at the rate hereinabove provided for a new vessel or motor based on the value thereof determined as provided in this subsection, but reduced as though same had been registered for each prior year of its existence. Except as provided in paragraph 1 of this subsection, the registration fee for the eleventh year computed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall be the amount of the fee to be assessed for such eleventh year and shall be the minimum annual registration fee for such vessel or motor for any subsequent year; and</p>

<p>6. The initial and subsequent registration fee for any vessel or motor which is not being used in a trade or business or for any commercial purpose and is owned by:</p>

<p>a. a nonresident member of the Armed Forces of the United States assigned to duty in this state in compliance with official military or naval orders,</p>

<p>b. a resident member of the Armed Forces of the United States assigned to duty in this state in compliance with official military or naval orders,</p>

<p>c. the spouse, who resides in Oklahoma, of a resident or nonresident member of the Armed Forces of the United States serving in a foreign country, or</p>

<p>d. any Oklahoma resident who is stationed out of state due to an official assignment of the Armed Forces of the United States,</p>

<p>shall be the lesser of either a Fifteen Dollar ($15.00) registration fee or the fee computed and assessed for vessels or motors of similar age and model pursuant to this section.</p>

<p>B. As used in this section, the term "manufacturer's factory delivered price" shall represent the recommended retail selling price and shall not mean the wholesale price to a dealer.</p>

<p>C. Service Oklahoma shall assess the registration fees and penalties for the year or years a vessel or motor was not registered as provided in the Oklahoma Vessel and Motor Registration Act. For vessels or motors not registered for two (2) or more years, the registration fees and penalties shall be due only for the current year and one (1) previous year.</p>

<p>D. Upon each vessel or motor repossessed by a mortgagee, a fee of Forty-six Dollars ($46.00) shall be assessed. This fee shall be in lieu of any applicable vessel or motor excise tax and registration fees. Through June 30, 2025, each licensed operator accepting applications for certificates of title for such vessel or motors shall receive Seven Dollars ($7.00) to be deducted from the license fee specified in this paragraph for each application accepted. Beginning July 1, 2025, these fees shall be retained by the licensed operator pursuant to subsection E of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83096">Section 1141.1 of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>E. All vessels or motors owned by the State of Oklahoma, its agencies or departments, or political subdivisions thereof, or which under the law would be exempt from direct ad valorem taxation, shall be registered pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Vessel and Motor Registration Act for an annual fee of Two Dollars and twenty-five cents ($2.25) irrespective of whether registered by a licensed operator or Service Oklahoma.</p>

<p>F. All vessels and motors owned:</p>

<p>1. By the Boy Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts of U.S.A., and the Camp Fire USA, devoted exclusively to youth programs emphasizing physical fitness, character development and citizenship training;</p>

<p>2. By the Department of Public Safety; and</p>

<p>3. By organizations which are exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 501(c)(3), and which are primarily devoted to the establishment, development, operation, promotion, and participation in, alone or in conjunction with others, educational and training programs and competitive events to provide knowledge, information, or comprehensive skills related to the sports of sailing, fishing, boating, and other aquatic-related activities;</p>

<p>are hereby exempt from the payment of registration fees required by this section. Provided all of such vessels or motors shall be registered and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of the Oklahoma Vessel and Motor Registration Act.</p>

<p>G. A credit shall be allowed with respect to the fee for registration of any new vessel or new motor, when such new vessel or motor is a replacement for:</p>

<p>1. A new original vessel or new original motor which is stolen from the purchaser/registrant within ninety (90) days of the date of purchase of the original vessel or new original motor as certified by a police report or other documentation as required by Service Oklahoma; or</p>

<p>2. A defective new original vessel or new original motor returned by the purchaser/registrant to the seller within six (6) months of the date of purchase of the defective new original vessel or new original motor as certified by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Such credit shall be in the amount of the fee for registration which was paid for the new original vessel or new original motor and shall be applied to the registration fee for the replacement vessel or motor. In no event will said credit be refunded.</p>

<p>H. Upon proper proof of a lost certificate of registration being made to Service Oklahoma or one of its licensed operators, accompanied by an application therefor and payment of the fees required by the Oklahoma Vessel and Motor Registration Act, a duplicate certificate of registration shall be issued to the applicant. The charge for such duplicate certificate of registration shall be Two Dollars and twenty-five cents ($2.25), which charge shall be in addition to any other fees imposed by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=100405">Section 4022</a> of this title for any such vessel or motor.</p>

<p>I. In addition to any other fees levied by the Oklahoma Vessel and Motor Registration Act, there is levied and there shall be paid to Service Oklahoma, for each year a vessel or motor is registered, a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) for each vessel or motor for which a registration or license fee is required pursuant to the provisions of this section. The fee shall accrue and shall be collected upon each vessel or motor under the same circumstances and shall be payable in the same manner and times as apply to vessel and motor licenses and registrations under the provisions of the Oklahoma Vessel and Motor Registration Act; provided, the fee shall be paid in full for the then current year at the time any vehicle is first registered in a calendar year.</p>

<p>Monies collected pursuant to this subsection shall be apportioned by Service Oklahoma to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Trauma Care Assistance Revolving Fund created in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439702">Section 1-2530.9</a> of this title.</p>

<p>The collection and payment of the fee shall be a prerequisite to license or registration of any vessel or motor.</p>

<p>J. If a vessel or motor is donated to a nonprofit charitable organization, the nonprofit charitable organization shall be exempt from paying any current or past due registration fees, excise tax, transfer fees, and penalties and interest; provided, subsequent to such donation, if the person, entity or party acting on another's behalf who donated the vessel or motor, purchases the same vessel or motor from the nonprofit charitable organization receiving the original donation, such person, entity or party acting on another's behalf shall be liable for all current and past due registration fees, excise tax, transfer fees, and penalties and interest on such vehicle.</p>
