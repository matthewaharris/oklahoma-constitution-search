<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Any tool;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Any implement; or</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Any instrumentality, including, but 
not limited to, any vessel or motor or vessel or motor part, whether owned or 
unowned by the person from whose possession or control it was seized, which is 
used or possessed either in violation of Section 3 of this act or to promote or 
facilitate a violation of Section 3 of this act.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Any vessel or motor, other 
conveyance, or vessel or motor part used by any person as a common carrier is 
subject to forfeiture under this section where the owner or other person in 
charge of the vessel or motor, other conveyance, or vessel or motor part is a 
consenting party to a violation of Section 3 of this act.</FONT></P>

vessel or motor part, or other conveyance encumbered by a bona fide security 
interest is subject to the interest of the secured party where the secured party

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Property described in subsection A of this section 
seized and held for forfeiture shall not be subject to replevin and is subject 
only to the order and judgments of a court of competent jurisdiction hearing the 
forfeiture proceedings.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. 1. The district attorney in the 
county where the seizure occurs shall bring an action for forfeiture in a court 
of competent jurisdiction. The forfeiture action shall be brought within sixty 
(60) days from the date of seizure except where the district attorney in the 
sound exercise of discretion determines that no forfeiture action should be 
brought because of the rights of property owners, lienholders, or secured 
creditors, or because of exculpatory, exonerating, or mitigating facts and 
circumstances.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The district attorney shall give notice of the 
forfeiture proceeding by mailing a copy of the complaint in the forfeiture 
proceeding to each person whose right, title, or interest is of record in the

hearing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such property was used in the 
commission of a violation of Section 3 of this act, or was used or possessed to 
facilitate such violation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. The owner of property may show by a preponderance 
of the evidence that the owner did not know, and did not have reason to know, 
that the property was to be used or possessed in the commission of any violation 
or that any of the exceptions to forfeiture are applicable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Unless the district attorney shall make the 
showing required of it, the court shall order the property released to the 
owner. Where the prosecutor has made such a showing, the court may 
order:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the property be destroyed by the agency which 
seized it or some other agency designated by the court,</FONT></P>

property, shall be paid to the general fund of the county of seizure or treasury
