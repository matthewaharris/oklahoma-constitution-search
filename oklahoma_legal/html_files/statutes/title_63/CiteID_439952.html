possessed in violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act;</P>
<P>2. All raw materials, products and equipment of any kind and all drug

introducing into the human body any controlled dangerous substance or synthetic 
controlled substance in violation of the provisions of the Uniform Controlled

subsection is unlawfully possessed by an occupant thereof, except that:</P>
<P>a. no conveyance used by a person as a common carrier in the transaction of 
business as a common carrier shall be forfeited under the provisions of the 
Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act unless it shall appear that the 
owner or other person in charge of such conveyance was a consenting party or 
privy to a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, and</P>
<P>b. no conveyance shall be forfeited under the provisions of this section by 
reason of any act or omission established by the owner thereof to have been 
committed or omitted without the knowledge or consent of such owner, and if the 
act is committed by any person other than such owner the owner shall establish 
further that the conveyance was unlawfully in the possession of a person other

seized pursuant to subsections A and B of this section shall not be applied or 
considered toward satisfaction of the fine imposed by Section 2-415 of this

the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission, the Director 
of the Department of Corrections, and the Attorney General shall follow the

bearing account by or at the direction of the State Treasurer if the seizing 
agency determines the currency is not to be held as evidence. All interest 
earned on such monies shall be returned to the claimant or forfeited with the 
money, coins, and currency which was taken or detained as provided by law.</P>

property, when the court declaring a forfeiture orders a distribution to such 
person; and</P>
<P>2. The balance to the Bureau of Narcotics Revolving Fund established pursuant 
to Section 2-107 of this title, provided the Bureau may enter into agreements 
with municipal, tribal, county, state or federal law enforcement agencies, or 
other state agencies with CLEET-certified law enforcement officers, assisting in 
the forfeiture or underlying criminal investigation, to return to such an agency 
a percentage of said proceeds.</P>
<P>G. Any agency that acquires seized or forfeited property or money shall 
maintain a true and accurate inventory and record of all such property seized 
pursuant to this section.</P>
