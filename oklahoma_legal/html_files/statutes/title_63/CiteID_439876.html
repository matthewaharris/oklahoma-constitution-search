<p>As used in the Nursing Home Care Act:</p>

<p>1. "Abuse" means the willful infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment, with resulting physical harm, impairment, or mental anguish;</p>

<p>2. "Access" means the right of a person to enter a facility to communicate privately and without unreasonable restriction when invited to do so by a resident. A representative of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman and a case manager employed by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services or one of its contract agencies shall have right of access to enter a facility, communicate privately and without unreasonable restriction with any resident who consents to the communication, to seek consent to communicate privately and without restriction with any resident, and to observe all areas of the facility that directly pertain to the patient care of the resident without infringing upon the privacy of the other residents without first obtaining their consent;</p>

<p>3. "Administrator" means the person licensed by the State of Oklahoma who is in charge of a facility. An administrator must devote at least one-third (1/3) of such person's working time to on-the-job supervision of the facility; provided, that this requirement shall not apply to an administrator of an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities with sixteen or fewer beds (ICF/IID-16), in which case the person licensed by the state may be in charge of more than one such ICF/IID-16 facility, if such facilities are located within a circle that has a radius of not more than fifteen (15) miles, the total number of facilities and beds does not exceed six facilities and sixty-four beds, and each such ICF/IID-16 facility is supervised by a qualified professional.

<p>c. on a regular basis, health-related care and services to individuals who because of their mental or physical condition require care and services beyond the level of care provided by a residential care home and which can be made available to them only through a nursing facility.</p>

The residents shall be persons who are ambulatory and essentially capable of managing their own affairs, but who do not routinely require nursing care; provided, the term residential care home shall not mean a hotel, motel, fraternity or sorority house, or college or university dormitory, if the facility operates in a manner customary to its description and does not house any person who requires supportive assistance from the facility in order to meet an adequate level of daily living;</p>

<p>18. "Resident" means a person residing in a facility due to illness, physical or mental infirmity, or advanced age;</p>

<p>19. "Representative of a resident" means a court-appointed guardian or, if there is no court-appointed guardian, the parent of a minor, a relative, or other person, designated in writing by the resident; provided, that any owner, operator, administrator, or employee of a facility subject to the provisions of the Nursing Home Care Act, the Residential Care Act, or the Group Homes for Persons with Developmental or Physical Disabilities Act shall not be appointed guardian or limited guardian of a resident of the facility unless the owner, operator, administrator, or employee is the spouse of the resident, or a relative of the resident within the second degree of consanguinity and is otherwise eligible for appointment; and</p>

<p>20.
