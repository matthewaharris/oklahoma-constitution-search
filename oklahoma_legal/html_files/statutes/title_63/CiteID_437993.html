<P>A. Except as specifically provided in the Smoking in Public Places and Indoor Workplaces Act, no person shall smoke tobacco or marijuana or vape marijuana in a public place, in any part of a zoo to which the public may be admitted, whether indoors or outdoors, in an indoor workplace, in any vehicle providing public transportation, at a meeting of a public body, in a nursing facility licensed pursuant to the Nursing Home Care Act, or in a child care facility licensed pursuant to the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act. A nursing facility licensed pursuant to the Nursing Home Care Act may designate tobacco smoking rooms for residents and their guests. Such rooms shall be fully enclosed, directly exhausted to the outside, and shall be under negative air pressure so that no tobacco smoke can escape when a door is opened and no air is recirculated to nonsmoking areas of the building. Commercial airport operators may prohibit the use of lighted tobacco or lighted marijuana or the vaping of marijuana in any area that is open to or used by the public whether located indoors or outdoors, provided that the outdoor area is within one hundred seventy-five (175) feet from an entrance.</P>
<P>B. 1. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2 of this subsection, a technology center school district which offers an early childhood education program or in which children in grades kindergarten through twelve are educated shall prohibit tobacco or marijuana smoking or marijuana vaping, the use of marijuana products, snuff, chewing tobacco or any other form of tobacco product in the educational facility buildings and on the grounds of the facility by all persons including, but not limited to, full-time, part-time, and contract employees, during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., during the school session, or when class or any program established for students is in session.</P>
<P>2. A technology center school district may designate tobacco smoking areas outside of buildings, away from general traffic areas and completely out of sight of children under eighteen (18) years of age, for use by adults attending training courses, sessions, meetings or seminars.</P>
<P>3. A technology center school district or college or university may designate tobacco smoking areas outside the educational facility buildings for the use of adults during certain activities or functions, including, but not limited to, athletic contests.</P>
<P>4. Smoking tobacco or marijuana or vaping marijuana shall be prohibited in an educational facility as defined in the 24/7 Tobacco-free Schools Act and as provided for in <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=476663">Section 1210.213 of Title 70</A> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P>C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit educational facilities from having more restrictive policies regarding tobacco or marijuana smoking or marijuana vaping and the use of other marijuana or tobacco products in the buildings or on the grounds of the facility.</P>
<P>D. A private residence is not a "public place" within the meaning of the Smoking in Public Places and Indoor Workplaces Act except that areas in a private residence that are used as a licensed child care facility during hours of operation are "public places" within the meaning of the Smoking in Public Places and Indoor Workplaces Act.</P>
<P>E. Smoking tobacco or marijuana or vaping marijuana is prohibited in all vehicles owned by the State of Oklahoma and all of its agencies and instrumentalities.</P>
<P>F. Veterans centers operated by this state pursuant to the provisions of <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=89067">Section 221 et seq. of Title 72</A> of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be designated nonsmoking effective January 1, 2015, at which time veterans centers may establish outdoor designated smoking areas for resident veterans only. Smoking tobacco shall only be allowed in designated outdoor smoking areas.</P>
<P>G. An employer not otherwise restricted from doing so may elect to provide tobacco smoking rooms where no work is performed except for cleaning and maintenance during the time the room is not in use for tobacco smoking, provided each tobacco smoking room is fully enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside, in such manner that no tobacco smoke can drift or circulate into a nonsmoking area. No exhaust from a tobacco smoking room shall be located within fifteen (15) feet of any entrance, exit or air intake. If tobacco smoking is to be permitted in any space exempted in subsection H of this section or in a tobacco smoking room pursuant to subsection I of this section, such tobacco smoking space must either occupy the entire enclosed indoor space or, if it shares the enclosed space with any nonsmoking areas, the tobacco smoking space shall be fully enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside with no air from the tobacco smoking space circulated to any nonsmoking area, and under negative air pressure so that no tobacco smoke can drift or circulate into a nonsmoking area when a door to an adjacent nonsmoking area is opened. Air from a tobacco smoking room shall not be exhausted within fifteen (15) feet of any entrance, exit or air intake.</P>
<P>H. The Smoking in Public Places and Indoor Workplaces Act shall not prohibit tobacco smoking in:</P>
<P>1. Stand-alone bars, stand-alone taverns or cigar bars;</P>
<P>2. The room or rooms where licensed charitable bingo games are being operated, but only during the hours of operation of such games;</P>
<P>3. Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the guest rooms at a hotel or other lodging establishment;</P>
<P>4. Retail tobacco stores predominantly engaged in the sale of tobacco products and accessories and in which the sale of other products is merely incidental and in which no food or beverage is sold or served for consumption on the premises;</P>
<P>5. Workplaces where only the owner or operator of the workplace, or the immediate family of the owner or operator, performs any work in the workplace, and the workplace has only incidental public access;</P>
<P>6. Workplaces occupied exclusively by one or more tobacco smokers, if the workplace has only incidental public access. "Incidental public access" means that a place of business has only an occasional person, who is not an employee, present at the business to transact business or make a delivery. It does not include businesses that depend on walk-in customers for any part of their business;</P>
<P>7. Private offices occupied exclusively by one or more smokers;</P>
<P>8. Workplaces within private residences, except that smoking tobacco or marijuana or vaping marijuana shall not be allowed inside any private residence that is used as a licensed child care facility during hours of operation;</P>
<P>9. A facility operated by a post or organization of past or present members of the Armed Forces of the United States which is exempt from taxation pursuant to Sections 501(c)(8), 501(c)(10) or 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 501(c)(8), 501(c)(10) or 501(c)(19), when such facility is utilized exclusively by its members and their families and for the conduct of post or organization nonprofit operations except during an event or activity which is open to the public;</P>
<P>10. Any outdoor seating area of a restaurant; provided, tobacco or marijuana smoking or vaping marijuana shall not be allowed within fifteen (15) feet of any exterior public doorway or any air intake of a restaurant; and</P>
<P>11. Medical research or treatment centers, if tobacco smoking is integral to the research or treatment. Furthermore, the restrictions on smoking or vaping of marijuana provided in this section shall not apply to medical research or treatment centers, if marijuana smoking or vaping is integral to the research or treatment.</P>
<P>I. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Smoking in Public Places and Indoor Workplaces Act, until March 1, 2006, restaurants may have designated tobacco smoking and nonsmoking areas or may be designated as being a totally nonsmoking area. Beginning March 1, 2006, restaurants shall be totally nonsmoking or may provide nonsmoking areas and designated tobacco smoking rooms. Food and beverage may be served in such designated tobacco smoking rooms which shall be in a location which is fully enclosed, directly exhausted to the outside, under negative air pressure so tobacco smoke cannot escape when a door is opened, and no air is recirculated to nonsmoking areas of the building. No exhaust from such room shall be located within twenty-five (25) feet of any entrance, exit or air intake. Such room shall be subject to verification for compliance with the provisions of this subsection by the State Department of Health.</P>
