<p>b. requiring licensees to track their marijuana and marijuana product inventory with the Authoritys designated seed-to-sale system provided the Authority has selected a seed-to-sale system. This requirement for compliance with the seed-to-sale system shall be mandatory for licensees seeking to achieve process validation whether or not compliance with a seed-to-sale system is mandatory for all licensees,</p>

<p>c. requiring licensees that are utilizing process validation to use a laboratory that is certified as a certified process validation testing laboratory,</p>

<p>d. requiring licensees to record and document retention policies, which at a minimum shall require licensees to retain all documents and records related to process validation. Such records shall be maintained by the licensee for as long as the licensee is continuing to operate under that validated process. Licensees shall retain all such documents and records for at least four (4) years after the licensee has stopped using the validated process or after the licensee has made a significant process change to a validated process. Any significant process change to the validated processes of a licensee is subject to the same document retention requirements and shall be retained for as long as the significant process change is part of an ongoing validated process, and for at least four (4) years after the licensee has stopped using the validated process or after the licensee has made a subsequent significant process change to the validated process. The Authority shall promulgate rules for any modifications to the validated processes,</p>

<p>e. requiring licensees to keep all records and documents related to their process validation ready and accessible at the address listed on their marijuana business license for inspection or audit by the Authority without any notice from the Authority,</p>

<p>f. a process for biannual inspections by the Authority that, at a minimum, includes random testing of products being produced under process validation. The Authority shall be the entity that obtains the random sample during the biannual inspections and shall have access to all products being produced or grown under process validation. The Authority shall take samples to the quality assurance laboratory,</p>

<p>g. a process to revoke the authority of licensees to operate under process validation,</p>

<p>h. punishment for violations of process validation that, at a minimum, would prohibit a licensee from operating under process validation for five (5) years and the assessment of a fine not to exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00). Any such fine levied against a licensee found to have violated the laws or rules of process validation shall be remitted to the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services,</p>

<p>i. punishment for violations if an adulterated product that was produced under process validation fails testing and the batch or lot has been sold to a dispensary, the first violation shall be the assessment of a fine not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) and a public recall of the product. The licensee shall further be required to revalidate the process. A second violation within two (2) years of a previous violation shall be the assessment of a fine not to exceed Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) and a public recall of the product. The licensee shall further be prohibited from utilizing process validation for a minimum of five (5) years. A third violation within two (2) years of a previous violation shall be the assessment of a fine of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and a public recall of the product. The licensee shall further be prohibited from utilizing process validation,</p>

<p>j. any willful violation of process validation shall result in the assessment of a fine of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and a license revocation hearing. A second willful violation of process validation shall result in the assessment of a fine of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and a hearing to permanently revoke the license,</p>

<p>k. an annual registration fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per licensee, in addition to any other fees due by the licensee, to be deposited in the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority Revolving Fund for the enforcement of the laws and regulations of the Authority,</p>

<p>l. establishing criteria for eligibility of testing laboratories to be certified as a Certified Process Validation Testing Laboratory and to conduct testing for licensees pursuing or operating under process validation. The criteria shall, at a minimum, pass five (5) consecutive blind proficiency tests without a failure over the course of six (6) months. The proficiency tests shall be administered by the quality assurance laboratory,</p>

<p>m. punishment for violations by a Certified Process Validation Testing Laboratory that has been found to have been falsifying data, providing misinformation, or any unethical practices related to process validation at a minimum shall prohibit a licensee from operating under process validation for up to twenty-five (25) years and the assessment of a fine not to exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00). Any such fine levied against a licensee shall be remitted to the Authority for deposit into the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority Revolving Fund. In addition to this fine, in response to a finding of a willful violation of process validation by the Authority, the Authority shall also be authorized to collect, levy, or impose any other fee, fine, penalty, or action as allowed by law, and</p>

<p>n. a process to revoke the certification of a testing laboratory that is seeking to be a Certified Process Validation Testing Laboratory;</p>

<p>3. Controlled access areas for storage of medical marijuana and medical marijuana product test samples, waste and reference standards;</p>

<p>4. Records to be retained and computer systems to be utilized by the laboratory;</p>

<p>5. The possession, storage and use by the laboratory of reagents, solutions and reference standards;</p>

<p>6. A certificate of analysis (COA) for each lot of reference standard;</p>

<p>7. The transport and disposal of unused marijuana, marijuana products and waste;</p>

The inventory tracking system reporting shall include the results of any tests that are conducted on medical marijuana, medical marijuana concentrate or medical marijuana product;</p>

<p>9. Standards of performance;</p>

<p>10. The employment of laboratory personnel;</p>

<p>11. A written standard operating procedure manual to be maintained and updated by the laboratory;</p>

<p>12. The successful participation in a proficiency testing program approved by the Executive Director for each testing category listed in this section, in order to obtain and maintain certification;</p>

<p>13. The establishment of and adherence to a quality assurance and quality control program to ensure sufficient monitoring of laboratory processes and quality of results reported;</p>

<p>14. The immediate recall of medical marijuana or medical marijuana products that test above allowable thresholds or are otherwise determined to be unsafe;</p>

<p>15. The establishment by the laboratory of a system to document the complete chain of custody for samples from receipt through disposal;</p>

<p>16. The establishment by the laboratory of a system to retain and maintain all required records, including business records, and processes to ensure results are reported in a timely and accurate manner; and</p>

<p>17. Any other aspect of laboratory testing of medical marijuana or medical marijuana product deemed necessary by the Executive Director.</p>

<p>O. A medical marijuana testing laboratory shall promptly provide the Authority or designee of the Authority access to a report of a test and any underlying data that is conducted on a sample at the request of a medical marijuana business or qualified patient. A medical marijuana testing laboratory shall also provide access to the Authority or designee of the Authority to laboratory premises and to any material or information requested by the Authority to determine compliance with the requirements of this section.</p>

<p>P. A medical marijuana testing laboratory shall retain all results of laboratory tests conducted on marijuana or products for a period of at least seven (7) years and shall make them available to the Authority upon request.</p>

<p>Q. A medical marijuana testing laboratory shall test samples from each harvest batch or, product batch, or samples consistent with the rules promulgated for process validation, as appropriate, of medical marijuana, medical marijuana concentrate and medical marijuana product for each of the following categories of testing, consistent with standards developed by the Executive Director:</p>
