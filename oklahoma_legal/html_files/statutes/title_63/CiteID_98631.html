<P>A. 1. The State Department of Health and the Department of Human Services 
shall conduct criminal history background checks on all current employees and 
applicants for employment of the State Department of Health and Department of 
Human Services whose responsibilities include working inside long-term care 
facilities on behalf of the State Department of Health or the Department of 
Human Services.</P>
<P>2. A criminal history background check shall be conducted on the following 
individuals whose responsibilities include working inside long-term care 
facilities:</P>
<P>a. any current employee of or applicant for employment with the State of 
Oklahoma,</P>
<P>b. any individual contracting with the State of Oklahoma,</P>
<P>c. any individual volunteering for a state-sponsored program,</P>
<P>d. any individual contracting with the Department of Human Services Advantage 
Waiver Program who enters any long-term care facility,</P>
<P>e. any individual providing services to the disabled or elderly in a facility 
or clients home, and</P>
<P>f. any individual employed by or volunteering for the State Long-term Care 
Ombudsman Program.</P>
<P>3. The State Department of Health and the Department of Human Services shall 
not hire or continue employment of an individual that has been convicted of the 
crimes listed in Section 1-1950.1 of this title. The criminal history background 
checks required by this section shall follow the requirements of Section 
1-1950.1 of this title.</P>
<P>B. The State Department of Health and the Department of Human Services shall 
also submit a list of all employees of the State Department of Health and the 
Department of Human Services who work inside long-term care facilities to the 
Department of Corrections. The Department of Corrections shall promptly notify 
the State Department of Health and the Department of Human Services of any 
employee who is required to register pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration 
Act or the Mary Rippy Violent Crime Offenders Registration Act.</P>
<P>C. The State Department of Health shall conduct an employment screening prior 
to an offer of employment to a Health Facilities Surveyor applicant. Each 
applicant shall fully disclose all employment history and professional licensure 
history, including actions taken regarding licensure. The Department shall 
review the compliance history of the facilities during the time of the 
applicants employment. If the applicant served as Director of Nursing or as an 
administrator during a survey that resulted in substandard quality of care and 
the facility failed to achieve compliance in an appropriate and timely manner, 
the applicant shall not be considered for employment. The Department shall also 
review professional licensure history of each applicant, including actions to 
suspend or revoke licenses by the Board of Nursing Home Administrators, Board of 
Nurse Licensure, or other applicable related licenses. Failure to fully disclose 
employment history and professional licensure actions shall constitute grounds 
for dismissal or prohibit employment as a surveyor.</P>
<P>D. Except as otherwise provided by subsection F of this section, an employer 
shall not employ, independently contract with, or grant clinical privileges to 
any individual who has direct patient access to service recipients of the 
employer, if one or more of the following are met:</P>
<P>1. If the results of a state and national criminal history records check 
reveal that the subject person has failed to act in conformity with all federal, 
state and municipal laws as applicable to his or her professional license, 
certification, permit or employment class, as established by the authority 
having jurisdiction for the subject persons professional license, 
certification, permit, or employment class;</P>
<P>2. If the individual is currently subject to an exclusion as described under 
Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 1320a-7;</P>
<P>3. If the individual is currently the subject of a substantiated finding of 
neglect, abuse, verbal abuse, misappropriation of property, maltreatment, or 
exploitation, by any state or federal agency pursuant to an investigation 
conducted in accordance with Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 
1395i-3(g)(1)(c) or 1396r(g)(1)(c), or Section 1-1950.7 or 1-1951 of this title; 
</P>
<P>4. If the individual is entered on the community services worker registry 
pursuant to Section 1025.3 of Title 56 of the Oklahoma Statutes;</P>
<P>5. If the individual is recorded on the Child Care Restricted Registry 
pursuant to Section 405.3 of Title 10 of the Oklahoma Statutes;</P>
<P>6. If the individual is registered pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration 
Act, the Mary Rippy Violent Crime Offenders Registration Act, or registered on 
another states sex offender registry; or</P>
<P>7. If the individual has direct patient access in an employment class not 
otherwise described in this subsection and is subject to a disqualifying 
condition identified in subsection B of Section 1-1950.1 of this title.</P>
<P>E. If the results of a registry screening or criminal history check reveal 
that an employee or a person hired, contracted with, or granted clinical 
privileges on a temporary basis pursuant to subsection L of this section has 
been disqualified pursuant to subsection D of this section, the Department shall 
advise the employer or requesting agency to immediately terminate the persons 
employment or contract.</P>
<P>F. Except as otherwise provided in subsection L of this section, an employer 
shall not employ, independently contract with, or grant privileges to, an 
individual who regularly has direct patient access to service recipients of the 
employer until the employer conducts a registry screening and criminal history 
record check in compliance with subsection I of this section. This subsection 
and subsection D of this section shall not apply to the following:</P>
<P>1. An individual who is employed by, under independent contract to, or 
granted clinical privileges with, an employer on or before November 1, 2012. An 
individual who is exempt under this subsection is not limited to working within 
the employer with which he or she is employed, under independent contract to, or 
granted clinical privileges. That individual may transfer to another employer 
that is under the same ownership with which he or she was employed, under 
contract, or granted privileges. If that individual wishes to transfer to 
another employer that is not under the same ownership, he or she may do so 
provided that a registry screening and criminal history record check are 
conducted by the new employer in accordance with subsection I of this 
section.</P>
<P>a. If an individual who is exempt under this subsection is subsequently 
found, upon seeking transfer to another employer, ineligible for employment, 
independent contract, or clinical privileges, as provided in subsection D of 
this section, then the individual is no longer exempt and shall be terminated 
from employment or denied employment.</P>
<P>b. If an individual who is exempt under this subsection is subsequently found 
ineligible for employment, independent contract, or clinical privileges, as 
provided in subsection D of this section, based on disqualifying events 
occurring after November 1, 2012, then the individual is no longer exempt and 
shall be terminated from employment; and</P>
<P>2. An individual who is an independent contractor to an employer, if the 
services for which he or she is contracted are not directly related to the 
provision of services to a service recipient or if the services for which he or 
she is contracted allow for direct patient access to service recipients but are 
not performed on an ongoing basis. This exception includes, but is not limited 
to, an individual who independently contracts with the employer to provide 
utility, maintenance, construction, or communications services.</P>
<P>G. A nurse aide scholarship program shall not accept into its training 
program candidates seeking eligibility for listing on the nurse aide registry 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(e)(2)(A) or 42 U.S.C. 1396r(e)(2)(A) until the 
training program conducts a registry screening and criminal history record check 
in compliance with subsection I of this section. The candidate shall be subject 
to the administrative fee in paragraph 1 of subsection J of this section. A 
nurse aide scholarship program shall not accept into enrollment a candidate 
ineligible for employment pursuant to Section 1-1950.1 of this title.</P>
<P>H. An applicant shall provide the employer a government photo identification 
of the applicant and written consent for the employer to conduct a registry 
screening and the Bureau to conduct a state and national criminal history record 
check under this section. The employer shall maintain the written consent and 
information regarding the individuals identification in their files for audit 
purposes.</P>
<P>I. 1. Upon receipt of the written consent and identification required under 
subsection H of this section, an employer shall submit an applicants name, any 
aliases, address, former states in which the applicant resided, social security 
number, and date of birth, through an Internet portal maintained by the 
Department, as provided in subsection V of this section, for the purpose of 
conducting a check of all relevant registries established pursuant to federal 
and state law and regulations for any findings barring employment. If the 
findings of the check do not reveal any basis that would prevent the employment 
of the applicant pursuant to subsection D of this section, and where the 
applicant does not have a monitored employment record pursuant to the provisions 
in subsection S of this section, the Department shall authorize the collection 
and submission of fingerprints through an authorized collection site to the 
Bureau for the performance of a criminal history record check on the applicant, 
pursuant to Section 150.9 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes and in accordance 
with U.S. Public Law 111-148. Results of such search conducted through both the 
Bureau and FBI databases shall be returned electronically to the Department.</P>
<P>2. The Bureau shall retain one set of fingerprints in the Automated 
Fingerprint Identification System and submit the other set to the FBI for a 
national criminal history records search.</P>
<P>3. Fingerprint images may be rejected by the Bureau or the FBI. A rejection 
of the fingerprints by the Bureau or the FBI shall require the applicant to be 
fingerprinted again.</P>
<P>4. The applicant shall have ten (10) calendar days, after receipt of 
authorization as provided in this subsection, to submit his or her fingerprints 
through an authorized collection site or his or her application shall be deemed 
withdrawn and the applicant shall be required to commence the application 
process from the beginning.</P>
<P>5. Medicaid home and community-based services waivered providers as defined 
in Section 1915 (c) or 1915 (i) of the federal Social Security Act may 
voluntarily participate in the submission of fingerprints for applicants. In 
lieu of fingerprinting, said providers shall obtain a name-based state criminal 
history record check from the Bureau at the fee established in Section 150.9 of 
Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes. No other fees shall apply to said providers 
relying on a name-based state criminal history record check. The determination 
of employment eligibility shall be made by said providers based on the criteria 
established in subsection D of this section.</P>
<P>J. 1. The employer shall pay a fee of Nineteen Dollars ($19.00) to the 
Department for each applicant submitted for fingerprinting or criminal history 
monitoring or both fingerprinting and criminal history monitoring pursuant to 
subsection S of this section. The prospective employee, independent contractor 
or clinical privileges candidate authorized for fingerprint collection by the 
Department shall pay an administrative fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00) at the time 
of fingerprinting. Subsequent fingerprinting shall not be required of an 
applicant if the applicant has a monitored employment record pursuant to 
subsection S of this section.</P>
<P>2. The Department shall be responsible for screening and fingerprinting and 
criminal history monitoring fees for persons participating in a Medicaid program 
who self-direct their own care, and the applicants of such self-directed care 
employers.</P>
<P>3. The Department shall use National Background Check grant funds, employer 
fees and administrative fee collections, and available Medicaid matching funds, 
to reimburse fingerprint collection vendors, pay administrative expenses, and 
reimburse the Bureau and FBI for each processed fingerprint review and automatic 
notification services for subsequent arrest. The Department shall reimburse 
fingerprint collection vendors, the Bureau, and the FBI, the applicable costs 
for those identified in paragraph 2 of this subsection.</P>
<P>4. At the consent of the current employee and request of an employer, the 
Department shall authorize the collection and submission of fingerprints for the 
purposes of conducting a criminal history record check on any person excluded 
from the criminal history requirements pursuant to subsection F of this section. 
The employer shall pay a fee of Sixty-five Dollars ($65.00) to the Department 
for the cost of registry screening, fingerprint collection and submission, and 
arrest record monitoring. The collection of fingerprints from those employed, 
contracted, or granted clinical privileges, prior to the effective date 
established by rule as authorized in subsection Y of this section, is voluntary 
and not required for the purposes of this section.</P>
<P>K. 1. If the criminal history record check results reveal information that 
precludes the Department from making a final determination of employment 
eligibility, the employer and applicant shall be given notice of such and the 
applicant shall have sixty (60) days to make any necessary corrections or 
additions for the Department to review.</P>
<P>2. If the applicant is unable to make corrections or additions to the record 
within the sixty (60) days, the Department shall deny employment based on the 
disqualifying results and shall notify the applicant of his or her right to 
appeal. The notice shall include the reasons why the applicant is not eligible 
for employment and a statement that the applicant has a right to appeal the 
decision made by the Department regarding the employment eligibility. The notice 
shall also include information regarding where to file and describe the 
appellate procedures.</P>
<P>L. If an employer determines it necessary to employ, contract with, or grant 
clinical privileges to an applicant before receiving the results of the 
applicants criminal history record check under this section, the employer may 
conditionally employ, conditionally contract with, or grant conditional clinical 
privileges to the applicant if all of the following apply:</P>
<P>1. The employer requests the criminal history record check under this section 
upon conditionally employing, contracting with, or granting clinical privileges 
to the individual;</P>
<P>2. The individual signs a statement in writing that indicates the applicant 
affirms and agrees to all of the following:</P>
<P>a. that the applicant is not disqualified from employment, an independent 
contract, or clinical privileges, based on the disqualifying criteria defined in 
subsection D of this section,</P>
<P>b. that the applicant agrees that, if the information in the registry 
screening and criminal history record check conducted under this section does 
not confirm the individuals statements under subparagraph a of this paragraph, 
his or her employment, independent contract, or clinical privileges shall be 
terminated by the employer as required under subsection D of this section unless 
and until the individual appeals and can provide that the information is 
incorrect, and</P>
<P>c. that the applicant understands that the conditions described in 
subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph may result in the termination of his or 
her employment, independent contract, or clinical privileges, and that those 
conditions are good cause for termination; and</P>
<P>3. The period of provisional employment shall not exceed sixty (60) days 
pending the completion of the required background check. During this time the 
employee shall be subject to direct on-site supervision. The sixty-day time 
period may only be extended for those employees who are appealing the results of 
the background check. The time period shall only be extended for the duration of 
the appeal.</P>
<P>M. The Department shall develop and distribute a model form for the statement 
required under paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section. The Department shall 
make the model form available to health facilities or agencies subject to this 
section upon request at no charge.</P>
<P>N. If an individual is employed as a conditional employee, has a conditional 
independent contract, or is granted conditional clinical privileges under 
subsection L of this section, and the report described in subsection I of this 
section does not confirm the individuals statement under subparagraph a of 
paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, the employer shall terminate the 
individuals employment, independent contract, or clinical privileges, as 
required by subsection E of this section.</P>
<P>O. An individual who knowingly provides false information regarding his or 
her identity, criminal convictions, or substantiated findings on a statement 
described in subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section is 
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than One Hundred 
Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00), imprisonment in 
the county jail for not more than thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and 
imprisonment.</P>
<P>P. The Department shall use criminal history record information obtained 
under subsection I of this section only for the purpose of evaluating an 
applicants qualifications for employment, an independent contract, or clinical 
privileges, in the position for which he or she has applied and for the purposes 
of subsections H and N of this section. The Department shall not disclose 
criminal history record information. An individual who knowingly uses or 
disseminates the criminal history record information obtained under subsection I 
of this section in violation of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor 
punishable by imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days or a fine of not 
more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), or both. Except for a knowing or 
intentional release of false information, the Department or employer has no 
liability in connection with a criminal history record check conducted under 
this section.</P>
<P>Q. As a condition of continued employment, each employee, independent 
contractor, or individual granted clinical privileges shall agree in writing to 
report to the employer immediately upon being arraigned or indicted for one or 
more of the criminal offenses listed in subsection D of this section, upon being 
convicted of, or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to, one or more of the 
criminal offenses listed in subsection D of this section, or upon being the 
subject of a substantiated finding on a relevant registry as described in 
subsection D of this section. Reporting of an arraignment under this subsection 
may be cause for leave without pay, placement under direct supervision, 
restriction from direct patient access, termination, or denial of 
employment.</P>
<P>R. An employer convicted for knowingly and willfully failing to conduct the 
criminal history checks as required under this section may be found guilty of a 
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than One Thousand Dollars 
($1,000.00) nor more than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00), imprisonment in 
the county jail for not more than thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and 
imprisonment.</P>
<P>S. The Department shall establish a database to store the records of an 
employers prospective and enrolled employees, the results of the screening and 
criminal arrest records search, and an identifier issued by the Bureau for the 
purposes of receiving an automatic notification from the Bureau if and when a 
subsequent criminal arrest record submitted into the system matches a set of 
fingerprints previously submitted in accordance with this section. Upon such 
notification, the Bureau shall immediately notify the Department and the 
Department shall immediately notify the respective employee. Information in the 
database established under this subsection is confidential, is not subject to 
disclosure under the Oklahoma Open Records Act, and shall not be disclosed to 
any person except for purposes of this act or for law enforcement purposes. The 
employee shall promptly respond to Department inquiries regarding the status of 
an arraignment or indictment. Reporting of an arraignment or indictment under 
this subsection may be cause for leave without pay, placement under direct 
supervision, restriction from direct patient access, termination, or denial of 
employment.</P>
<P>T. 1. Any individual who has been disqualified from or denied employment by 
an employer pursuant to this section may file an appeal with the Department 
within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the notice of disqualification, if the 
applicant believes that the criminal history report is inaccurate or that 
consideration of the passage of time, extenuating circumstances, demonstration 
of rehabilitation, or relevancy of the particular disqualifying information with 
respect to the current or proposed employment of the individual merits a waiver 
of the disqualification or employment denial.</P>
<P>2. The Department shall specify in rule the criteria for issuing a waiver of 
the disqualification or employment denial. The criteria shall include 
consideration of the passage of time, extenuating circumstances, demonstration 
of rehabilitation, and relevancy of the particular disqualifying information 
with respect to the current or proposed employment of the individual.</P>
<P>3. The appeal shall be conducted as an individual proceeding pursuant to the 
Administrative Procedures Act.</P>
<P>U. An employer who has acted in good faith to comply with the requirements of 
this section of law shall be immune from liability in carrying out the 
provisions of this section. </P>
<P>V. The Department shall maintain an electronic web-based system to assist 
employers, and nurse aide scholarship programs, required to check relevant 
registries and conduct criminal history record checks of its prospective 
students, employees, independent contractors, and those to whom the employer 
would grant clinical privileges. The employer shall maintain the status of the 
employment, contract, or privileges in the system, and the Department shall 
provide for an automated notice to employers for those employees, independent 
contractors, and those granted clinical privileges, who, since the initial 
check, have been convicted of a disqualifying offense or have been the subject 
of a substantiated finding on a relevant registry. </P>
<P>W. The Department is authorized to obtain any criminal history records 
maintained by the Bureau and FBI which the Department is required or authorized 
to request by the provisions of this section.</P>
<P>X. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a revolving fund for the 
Department to be designated the "Oklahoma National Background Check Fund". The 
fund shall be a continuing fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations, and 
shall consist of all monies received by the Department from employers and 
administrative fees collected pursuant to this section. Screening and 
administrative fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into 
the fund. All monies accruing to the credit of the fund are hereby appropriated 
and may be budgeted and expended by the Department for the following 
purposes:</P>
<P>1. Obtaining available Medicaid funds for screening, fingerprinting, the cost 
of criminal history records obtained from the Bureau and FBI, and program 
administration;</P>
<P>2. Reimbursement of fingerprint collection vendors;</P>
<P>3. Reimbursement to the Bureau and FBI for criminal history records; and</P>
<P>4. Administrative and other applicable expenses of the Department related to 
the background check program.</P>
<P>Y. The Department is authorized to phase in implementation of subsections D 
through V of this section by category of employer. The State Board of Health 
shall promulgate rules prescribing effective dates and procedures for the 
implementation of a national criminal history record check for the employers and 
nurse aide scholarship programs defined in Section 1-1945 of this title. Said 
dates may be staggered to facilitate implementation of the requirements of this 
section.</P>
<P>Z. On or before November 1, 2015, the Department shall submit a written 
report to the Legislature detailing the fee collections and costs for the 
previous three (3) years and revolving fund projections for the next five (5) 
years. A plan shall be provided to cover the costs of the criminal history 
checks required under this section if funding is inadequate to cover the costs 
of the criminal history checks required under this section after November 1, 
2020.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
