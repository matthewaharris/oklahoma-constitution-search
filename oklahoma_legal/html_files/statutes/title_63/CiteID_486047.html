<p>Upon reasonable suspicion that a medical marijuana business licensee is illegally growing, processing, transferring, selling, disposing, or diverting marijuana, the Authority, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI), or the Attorney General may subpoena documents necessary to establish the personal identifying information of all owners and individuals with any ownership interest in the business;</p>

<p>8. There shall be no limit to the number of medical marijuana business licenses or categories that an individual or entity can apply for or receive, although each application and each category shall require a separate application, application fee, or license fee.

<p>g. criminal acts relating to the operation of a medical marijuana business, or</p>

<p>h. any violations that endanger public health and safety or product safety.</p>

<p>I. In investigating the qualifications of an applicant or a licensee, the Authority and municipalities may have access to criminal history record information furnished by a criminal justice agency subject to any restrictions imposed by such an agency.</p>

<p>J. The failure of an applicant or licensee to provide the requested information by the Authority deadline may be grounds for denial of the application.</p>

<p>K. All applicants and licensees shall submit information to the Authority in a full, faithful, truthful and fair manner. The Authority may recommend denial of an application where the applicant or licensee made misstatements, omissions, misrepresentations or untruths in the application or in connection with the background investigation of the applicant. This type of conduct may be grounds for administrative action against the applicant or licensee. Typos and scrivener errors shall not be grounds for denial.</p>

<p>L. A licensed medical marijuana business premises shall be subject to and responsible for compliance with applicable provisions consistent with the zoning where such business is located as described in the most recent versions of the Oklahoma Uniform Building Code, the International Building Code and the International Fire Code, unless granted an exemption by a municipality or appropriate code enforcement entity.</p>

<p>M.

Applicants and licensees shall remit all required license and application fees, including any additional licensing fees, if applicable, in full within forty-five (45) days of notification by the Authority. Failure to remit such fees shall result in the denial of the application.</p>

<p>N.

Only license renewal applications submitted at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the expiration date shall be considered timely submitted and subject to the provisions of subsection F of this section. A medical marijuana business license shall remain unexpired during the pendency of the application for renewal provided that such application was timely submitted.

<p>O.

<p>P. A medical marijuana business license holder shall require all individuals employed under his or her license to be issued a credential pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=492473">Section 427.14b</a> of this title prior to employment.</p>

<p>Q. An original medical marijuana business license issued on or after June 26, 2018, by the Authority, for a medical marijuana commercial grower, a medical marijuana processor or a medical marijuana dispensary shall be deemed to have been grandfathered into the location on the date the original license was first issued for purposes of determining the authority of the business to conduct and continue the same type of business at that location under a license issued by the Authority, except as may be provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=483204">Sections 425</a> and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=486108">426.1</a> of this title. Any change in ownership after the original medical marijuana business license has been issued by the Authority shall be construed by the Authority to be a continuation of the same type of business originally licensed at that location. Nothing shall authorize the Authority to deny issuance or renewal of a license or transfer of license due to a change in ownership for the same business location previously licensed, except when a revocation is otherwise authorized by law or a protest is made under the municipal compliance provisions of Section 426.1 of this title.</p>

<p>R. A medical marijuana business license holder shall require all individuals employed under their license to be issued a credential pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=492473">Section 427.14b</a> of this title prior to employment.</p>

<p>S. The Executive Director of the Authority may promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section including, but not limited to, required application materials to be submitted by the applicant and utilized by the Authority to determine medical marijuana business licensing fees pursuant to this section.</p>
