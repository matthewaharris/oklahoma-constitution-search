any part thereof. Provided, however, that a public hearing to consider a 
proposed project requiring construction, purchasing, leasing or renting of more 
than twenty new housing units shall be held together by the authority and 
governing body, and any such project must be found to be in the public interest 
by a majority of the members constituting said authority and a majority of the

this provision shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general

not more than thirty (30) days prior to said hearing; provided that an 
additional public hearing shall be held by the authority before the same shall 
select any location for any contiguous or noncontiguous area of land on which

salaries or wages and maximum hours of labor, and comply with any conditions 
attached to the financial aid of the project. Construction, restitution, 
improvement, extension, alteration or major repair of any project or any part

section shall prevent a local housing authority from requesting proposals from 
property owners and/or developers to provide certain kinds of housing to the 
housing authority either presently existing or to be developed; provided, that 
the local authority establish safeguards relating to laws and regulations of the 
United States wherein the same has entered into contracts with the authority to

give preference in its awarding of a contract in all forms so long as the 
services to be performed, or the construction of buildings, dwellings, site 
improvements, repairs or renovation is to be performed or carried out on a 
federally recognized tribal reservation or former reservations and only then 
upon land held in trust by, or owned by, the respective Indian tribe; and
