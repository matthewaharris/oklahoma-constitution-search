<p>A. As used in this section:</p>

<p>1. Arrested means taking custody of another for the purpose of holding or detaining him or her to answer a criminal charge;</p>

<p>2. Convicted means any final adjudication of guilt, whether pursuant to a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or otherwise, and any deferred or suspended sentence or judgment;</p>

<p>3. Court means any state or municipal court having jurisdiction to impose a criminal fine or penalty; and</p>

<p>4. DNA means deoxyribonucleic acid.</p>

<p>B. Any person convicted of an offense including traffic offenses but excluding parking and standing violations, punishable by a fine of Ten Dollars ($10.00) or more or by incarceration or any person forfeiting bond when charged with such an offense, shall be ordered by the court to pay Ten Dollars ($10.00) as a separate fee, which fee shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any and all fines and penalties otherwise provided for by law for such offense.</p>

<p>C. 1. Any person convicted of any misdemeanor or felony offense shall pay a Laboratory Analysis Fee in the amount of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) for each offense if forensic science or laboratory services are rendered or administered by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI), by the Toxicology Laboratory of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner or by any municipality or county in connection with the case. This fee shall be in addition to and not a substitution for any and all fines and penalties otherwise provided for by law for this offense.</p>

<p>2. The court clerk shall cause to be deposited the amount of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) as collected, for every conviction as described in this subsection. The court clerk shall remit the monies in the fund on a monthly basis directly either to:</p>

<p>a. the OSBI who shall deposit the monies into the OSBI Revolving Fund provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=101448">Section 150.19a of Title 74</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes for services rendered or administered by the OSBI,</p>

<p>b. the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner who shall deposit the monies into the Chief Medical Examiner Revolving Fund provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=99897">Section 948 of Title 63</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes for services rendered or administered by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, or</p>

<p>c. the appropriate municipality or county for services rendered or administered by a municipality or county.</p>

<p>3. The monies from the Laboratory Analysis Fee Fund deposited into the OSBI Revolving Fund shall be used for the following:</p>

<p>a. providing criminalistic laboratory services,</p>

<p>b. the purchase and maintenance of equipment for use by the laboratory in performing analysis,</p>

<p>c. education, training, and scientific development of OSBI personnel, and</p>

<p>D. Upon conviction or bond forfeiture, the court shall collect the fee provided for in subsection B of this section and deposit it in an account created for that purpose. Except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this section, monies shall be forwarded monthly by the court clerk to the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training (CLEET). Beginning July 1, 2003, deposits shall be due on the fifteenth day of each month for the preceding calendar month.

Along with the deposits required by this subsection, each court shall also submit a report stating the total amount of funds collected and the total number of fees imposed during the preceding quarter. The report may be made on computerized or manual disposition reports.</p>

<p>E. Any municipality or county having a basic law enforcement academy approved by CLEET pursuant to the criteria developed by CLEET for training law enforcement officers shall retain from monies collected pursuant to subsections A through D of this section, Two Dollars ($2.00) from each fee. These monies shall be deposited into an account for the sole use of the municipality or county in implementing its law enforcement training functions. Not more than seven percent (7%) of the monies shall be used for court and prosecution training. The court clerk of any such municipality or county shall furnish to CLEET the report required by subsection D of this section.</p>

<p>F. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a fund for the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training to be designated the CLEET Fund. The fund shall be subject to legislative appropriation and shall consist of any monies received from fees and receipts collected pursuant to the Oklahoma Open Records Act, reimbursements for parts used in the repair of weapons of law enforcement officers attending the basic academies, gifts, bequests, contributions, tuition, fees, devises and the assessments levied pursuant to the fund pursuant to law.</p>

<p>2. The court clerk shall cause to be deposited the amount of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) as collected for every felony arrest, felony conviction or every conviction for a misdemeanor offense of assault and battery, domestic abuse, stalking, possession of a controlled substance prohibited under the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, outraging public decency, resisting arrest, escaping or attempting to escape, eluding a police officer, Peeping Tom, pointing a firearm, threatening an act of violence, breaking and entering a dwelling place, destruction of property, negligent homicide or causing a personal injury accident while driving under the influence of any intoxicating substance as described in this subsection. The court clerk shall remit the monies in the fund on a monthly basis directly to the OSBI who shall deposit the monies into the OSBI Revolving Fund provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=101448">Section 150.19a of Title 74</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes for services rendered or administered by the OSBI.</p>

<p>3. The monies from the DNA sample fee deposited into the OSBI Revolving Fund shall be used for creating, staffing and maintaining the OSBI DNA Laboratory and OSBI Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) Database.</p>

<p>H. It shall be the responsibility of the court clerk to account for and ensure the correctness and accuracy of payments made to the state agencies identified in Sections 1313.2 through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=214846">1313.4</a> of this title.
