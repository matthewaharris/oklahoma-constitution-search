<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>CANADIAN RIVER COMPACT</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The State of New Mexico, the state of Texas, and the 
State of Oklahoma, acting through their Commissioners, John H. Bliss for the 
State of New Mexico, E. V. Spence for the State of Texas, and Clarence Burch for 
the State of Oklahoma, after negotiations participated in by Berkeley Johnson,

<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE I</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The major purposes of this Compact are to promote 
interstate comity; to remove causes of present and future controversy; to make 
secure and protect present developments within the states; and to provide for 
the construction of additional works for the conservation of the waters of 
Canadian River.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE II</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As used in this Compact:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The term "Canadian River" means the tributary of 
Arkansas River which rises in northeastern New Mexico and flows in an easterly 
direction through New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma and includes North Canadian 
River and all other tributaries of said Canadian River.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The term "North Canadian River" means that major 
tributary of Canadian River officially known as North Canadian River from its 
source to its junction with Canadian River and includes all tributaries of North 
Canadian River.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The term "Commission" means the agency created by 
this Compact for the administration thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The term "conservation storage" means that 
portion of the capacity of reservoirs available for the storage of water for 
subsequent release for domestic, municipal, irrigation and industrial uses, or 
any of them, and it excludes any portion of the capacity of reservoirs allocated 
solely to flood control, power production and sediment control, or any of 
them.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE III</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>All rights to any of the waters of Canadian River 
which have been perfected by beneficial use are hereby recognized and 
affirmed.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IV</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) New Mexico shall have free and unrestricted use 
of all waters originating in the drainage basin of Canadian River above Conchas 
Dam.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) New Mexico shall have free and unrestricted use

basin of Canadian River below Conchas Dam shall be limited to an aggregate of 
two hundred thousand 200,000 acre-feet.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The right of New Mexico to provide conservation 
storage in the drainage basin of North Canadian River shall be limited to the 
storage of such water as at the time may be unappropriated under the laws of New 
Mexico and of Oklahoma.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE V</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Texas shall have free and unrestricted use of all 
waters of Canadian River in Texas, subject to the limitations upon storage of 
water set forth below:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The right of Texas to impound any of the waters 
of North Canadian River shall be limited to storage on tributaries of said River 
in Texas for municipal uses, for household and domestic uses, livestock 
watering, and the irrigation of lands which are cultivated solely for the 
purpose of providing food and feed for the households and domestic livestock 
actually living or kept on the property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Until more than three hundred thousand 300,000 
acre-feet of conservation storage shall be provided in Oklahoma, exclusive of 
reservoirs in the drainage basin of North Canadian River and exclusive of 
reservoirs in the drainage basin of Canadian River east of the 97th meridian, 
the right of Texas to retain water in conservation storage, exclusive of waters 
of north Canadian River, shall be limited to five hundred thousand 500,000 
acre-feet; thereafter the right of Texas to impound and retain such waters in

200,000 acre-feet plus whatever amount of water shall be at the same time in 
conservation storage in reservoirs in the drainage basin of Canadian River in 
Oklahoma, exclusive of reservoirs in the drainage basin of North Canadian River 
and exclusive of reservoirs east of the 97th meridian; and for the purpose of 
determining the amount of water in conservation storage, the maximum quantity of 
water in storage following each flood or series of floods shall be used; 
provided, that the right of Texas to retain and use any quantity of water 
previously impounded shall not be reduced by any subsequent application of the 
provisions of this paragraph (b).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Should Texas for any reason impound any amount of 
water greater than the aggregate quantity specified in paragraph (b) of this 
article, such excess shall be retained in storage until under the provisions of 
said paragraph Texas shall become entitled to its use; provided, that, in event 
of spill from conservation storage, any such excess shall be reduced by the 
amount of such spill from the most easterly reservoir on Canadian River in 
Texas; provided further, that all such excess quantities in storage shall be 
reduced monthly to compensate for reservoir losses in proportion to the total 
amount of water in the reservoir or reservoirs in which such excess water is 
being held; and provided further that on demand by the Commissioner for Oklahoma 
the remainder of any such excess quantity of water in storage shall be released 
into the channel of Canadian River at the greatest rate practicable.</FONT></P>

water than the amount set forth in Article IV and may permit Texas to impound 
more water than the amount set forth in Article V; provided, that no state shall 
thereby be deprived of water needed for beneficial use; provided further that 
each such permission shall be for a limited period not exceeding twelve (12) 
months; and provided further that no state or user of water within any state 
shall thereby acquire any right to the continued use of any such quantity of 
water so permitted to be impounded.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) There is hereby created an interstate 
administrative agency to be known as the "Canadian River Commission." The 
Commission shall be composed of three (3) commissioners, one from each of the 
signatory states, designated or appointed in accordance with the laws of each 
such state, and if designated by the President an additional Commissioner 
representing the United States. The President is hereby requested to designate 
such a Commissioner. If so designated, the Commissioner representing the United 
States shall be the presiding officer of the Commission, but shall not have the 
right to vote in any of the deliberations of the Commission. All members of the 
Commission must be present to constitute a quorum. A unanimous vote of the 
Commissioners for the three signatory States shall be necessary to all actions 
taken by the Commission.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The salaries and personal expenses of each 
Commissioner shall be paid by the government which he represents. All other 
expenses which are incurred by the Commission incident to the administration of 
this Compact and which are not paid by the United States shall be borne equally 
by the three states and be paid by the Commission out of a revolving fund hereby 
created to be known as the "Canadian River Revolving Fund." Such fund shall be 
initiated and maintained by equal payments of each state into the fund in such 
amounts as will be necessary for administration of this Compact. Disbursements 
shall be made from said fund in such manner as may be authorized by the 
Commission. Said fund shall not be subject to the audit and accounting 
procedures of the States. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds 
handled by the Commission shall be audited by a qualified independent public 
accountant at regular intervals and the report of the audit shall be included in 
and become a part of the annual report of the Commission.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The Commission may:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) Employ such engineering, legal, clerical, and 
other personnel as in its judgment may be necessary for the performance of its 
functions under this Compact;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) Enter into contracts with appropriate federal 
agencies for the collection, correlation, and presentation of factual data, for 
the maintenance of records, and for the preparation of reports;</FONT></P>

Compact and do all things necessary, proper, or convenient in the performance of 
its duties hereunder, independently or in cooperation with appropriate 
governmental agencies.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The Commission shall:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) Cause to be established, maintained and operated 
such stream and other gaging stations and evaporation stations as may from time 
to time be necessary for proper administration of the Compact, independently or 
in co-operation with appropriate governmental agencies;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) Make and transmit to the Governors of the 
signatory states on or before the last day of March of each year, a report 
covering the activities of the Commission for the preceding year;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) Make available to the Governor of any signatory 
state, on his request, any information within its possession at any time, and 
shall always provide access to its records by the Governors of the states, or 
their representatives, or by authorized representatives of the United 
States.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE X</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nothing in this Compact shall be construed as:</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Affecting the obligations of the United States to 
the Indian Tribes;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Subjecting any property of the United States, its 
agencies or instrumentalities, to taxation by any State or subdivision thereof, 
or creating any obligation on the part of the United States, its agencies or 
instrumentalities, by reason of the acquisition, construction or operation of 
any property or works of whatever kind, to make any payment to any State or 
political subdivision thereof, state agency, municipality or entity whatsoever, 
in reimbursement for the loss of taxes;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Subjecting any property of the United States, its 
agencies or instrumentalities, to the laws of any State to an extent other than 
the extent to which such laws would apply without regard to this 
Compact;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) Applying to, or interfering with, the right or 
power of any signatory State to regulate within its boundaries the 
appropriation, use and control of water, not inconsistent with its obligations 
under this Compact;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) Establishing any general principle or precedent 
applicable to other interstate streams.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE XI</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This Compact shall become binding and obligatory when 
it shall have been ratified by the Legislature of each state and approved by the 
Congress of the United States. Notice of ratification by the Legislature of each 
state shall be given by the Governor of that state to the Governors of the other 
states and to the President of the United States. The President is hereby 
requested to give notice to the Governor of each state of approval by the 
Congress of the United States.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In Witness Whereof, the Commissioners have executed 
four counterparts hereof, each of which shall be and constitute an original, one 
of which shall be deposited in the archives of the Department of State of the 
United States, and one of which shall be forwarded to the Governor of each
