To develop and generate water power, electric power and electric energy, from whatever source, within the boundaries of the district; to acquire coal or other minerals to be used for the purposes of providing energy sources for electrical generating plants; to acquire or lease any and all railroad connections, equipment, rolling stock, trackage and otherwise, necessary to the transporting of coal and other minerals to generating plant sites within the district; and to buy, sell, resell, interchange and distribute electric power and energy in order to carry forward the business and functions of the district now or hereafter authorized by law and may enter into contracts for such purposes, such contracts to run for a period of not to exceed fifty (50) years except those contracts provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this section.

The Board of Directors shall adopt a hedging policy to enable the district to take advantage of standard market products to reduce risk while preventing speculative trading and potential abuses;</P>
<P>3. To prevent or aid in the prevention of damage to person or property from the waters of the Grand River and its tributaries;</P>
<P>4. To forest and reforest and to aid in the foresting and reforesting of the watershed area of the Grand River and its tributaries and to prevent and to aid in the prevention of soil erosion and floods within the watershed area;</P>
<P>5. To acquire by purchase, lease, gift, or in any other manner, and to maintain, use and operate or to contract for the maintenance, use and operation of any and all property of any kind, real, personal, or mixed, or any interest therein, including trucks of any size or weight and passenger vehicles and to own, construct, operate and maintain any project or works in conjunction or jointly with, as tenants in common, any public or private corporation duly authorized and qualified to do business within this state including, but not limited to, rural electric cooperatives of the State of Oklahoma or the United States of America, or any department, subdivision or agency of the State of Oklahoma or the United States of America, or with any "public agency" as defined under the Interlocal Cooperation Act, within or without the boundaries of the district, necessary, incidental or convenient to the exercise of the powers, rights, privileges and functions conferred upon it by the Grand River Dam Authority Act;</P>
<P>6. In addition to any other powers conferred, the district shall have power and authority to participate and enter into agreements with any public or private corporation duly authorized and qualified to do business within the State of Oklahoma including, but not limited to, rural electric cooperatives, the state or the United States of America or any department, subdivision or agency of the state or the United States of America, or with any "public agency" as defined under the Interlocal Cooperation Act, for the purpose of planning, acquiring, financing, owning, operating and maintaining an undivided ownership of any electric generating plant or plants or any facilities of every kind necessary, incidental or convenient for the production, generation and transmission of electric power and energy including, but not limited to, any and all related transmission facilities, which shall be used as common facilities.

<P>7. In addition to the powers conferred in paragraph 6 of this section, the district shall have power and authority to participate and enter into agreements with any public or private corporation duly authorized and qualified to do business within this state including, but not limited to, rural electric cooperatives, the State of Oklahoma or the United States of America or any department, subdivision or agency of the State of Oklahoma or the United States of America, or with any "public agency" as defined under the Interlocal Cooperation Act, for the purpose of planning, acquiring, financing, owning, operating and maintaining undivided ownership interests in any electric generating plant or plants or any other facilities of every kind necessary, incidental or convenient for the production, generation and transmission of electric power and energy including, but not limited to, any and all related transmission or other facilities which are to be used as common facilities and to cooperate with other state agencies and public trusts to promote economic development in the state and to assist in attracting industry to the state.
