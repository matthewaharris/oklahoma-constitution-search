<P>A. Each director of the board shall take and subscribe to the official oath 
of office and execute a surety bond to the district conditioned upon the 
faithful discharge of his duties.</P>
<P>B. The board shall:</P>
<P>1. Elect a president or chairman and vice-president or vice-chairman from its 
members and elect or appoint a secretary-treasurer. The secretary-treasurer of 
the board shall be bonded;</P>
<P>2. Conduct its business in open meeting, pursuant to the Oklahoma Open 
Meeting Act;</P>
<P>3. Maintain its records pursuant to the Oklahoma Open Records Act, except 
those records which are considered private or confidential under applicable laws 
of the United States;</P>
<P>4. Have standing to appear before any court of this state. Such standing 
shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the district 
including but not limited to questions of the validity of the establishment and 
operation of the district, contracts and collection of delinquent 
assessments;</P>
<P>5. On a date specified by the board, each year, prepare a budget, estimating 
the amount of money required for the ensuing year to meet all obligations of the 
district and determine the assessments necessary to pay those obligations. 
Assessments may be modified or adopted by the Board when determined 
necessary;</P>
<P>6. Determine collection procedures for all assessments imposed by the 
district. Assessments may be set by the board for all expenses of the district 
including the establishment and maintenance of a reserve fund, provided, 
however, that any assessments for construction or improvements and the principal 
indebtedness and interest which may be incurred relating thereto shall be 
approved by vote of the electors. The amount approved by the electors for 
construction or improvements may include additional amounts necessary for the 
establishment of a reasonable reserve and the payment of costs of issuance and 
underwriters' discount. The maximum amount of principal indebtedness and 
interest shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated 
cost of such construction or improvement, in order to provide for contingencies. 
All plans of construction and improvements shall be submitted to the Oklahoma 
Water Resources Board;</P>
<P>7. Let contracts for public improvements or public construction projects of 
the district. Such improvements or construction projects shall be on sealed bids 
to the lowest and best responsible bidder and shall be conditioned upon the 
filing of a performance bond equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the contract 
price for the faithful performance of the contract except as otherwise provided 
by the Public Competitive Bidding Act;</P>
<P>8. Cause an independent auditor to prepare and furnish an annual certified 
audit of the financial condition of the district for the preceding year to the 
board. A copy of such audit shall be submitted to the Oklahoma Water Resources 
Board, and made available to the electors and creditors of the district; and</P>
<P>9. In the best interests of the entire district, establish a written 
comprehensive and reasonable plan of operation for the release, distribution, 
and use of water among the owners of lands within the district. Prior to the 
adoption of any final plan of operation or amendments thereto, the board shall 
provide for a meeting on the proposed or modified plan of operation. Notice of 
the intended action shall be mailed to the electors. Copies of the plan or 
amendments thereto shall be made available, at no charge, to the electors. The 
board shall fully consider all written and oral submissions respecting the plan 
or amendments thereto. A final plan of operation or amendments thereto shall be 
submitted to the electors for approval at the annual meeting or at a special 
meeting of the electors called for such approval. Upon approval of such plan or 
amendments thereto, the plan or plan as amended shall constitute the official 
plan of operation for the district. Copies of the official plan of operation for 
the district shall be made available to the public.</P>
<P>C. The board shall have the power and authority to:</P>
<P>1. Manage and conduct the business affairs of the district;</P>
<P>2. Make and execute all necessary contracts;</P>
<P>3. Organize as a municipal corporation;</P>
<P>4. Employ such agents, officers and employees, including but not limited to a

<P>5. Institute, maintain and defend any and all actions, suits and proceedings, 
in person or by counsel, in the name of the district;</P>
<P>6. Appear before the Oklahoma Water Resources Board to protest any 
application not in conformity with the district's plan of operation or not in 
the best interests of the district;</P>
<P>7. Perform any lawful act necessary to provide sufficient water to each 
elector in the district;</P>
<P>8. Provide for the proper drainage of all lands affected by the operations of 
the district;</P>
<P>9. Procure water either inside or outside of this state;</P>
<P>10. Develop comprehensive plans for efficient use of streams and groundwater 
and the control and prevention of waste. Such plans shall be filed with the 
Oklahoma Water Resources Board for informational purposes only;</P>
<P>11. Reclassify or authorize transfer of existing lands of the district as 
provided in the Oklahoma Irrigation District Act;</P>
<P>12. For the purposes of the district:</P>
<P>a. acquire by purchase, lease or grant, rights-of-way and improvement 
locations, and release such acquired interests, provided that the acquisition or 
release of the property or facilities of public service corporations shall be 
accomplished as provided for by Section 1722 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes,</P>
<P>b. enter upon lands for the making of surveys, provided consent for such 
entry is first obtained,</P>
<P>c. condemn lands in accordance with the procedure provided for condemnation 
of land by railroad corporations. The power of eminent domain shall not be 
exercised to acquire water rights unless the land is acquired in fee. Oil, gas

extent necessary to prevent activities adversely affecting the purposes of the 
district,</P>

federal acts for the acquisition of water supply and distribution 
facilities;</P>
<P>13. Accept the appointment of the district as fiscal agent of the United 
States or this state, or accept authorization of the district by the United 
States or this state to make collection of money for and on behalf of the United 
States or this state in connection with any federal or state project, and assume 
the duties and liabilities incident to such action, and do any and all things 
required by rules and regulations now or hereafter established by any agency or 
department of the federal or state government in regard thereto;</P>
<P>14. Accept gifts of money, property and services;</P>
<P>15. Sell and dispose of the property of the district if provision is made for 
the payment of indebtedness thereon and consent is obtained from all 
lienholders:</P>
<P>a. all property except easements shall be sold by sealed bid to the highest 
bidder but the board has the right to reject all such bids,</P>
<P>b. if real property has been acquired by the district through the exercise of 
the power of eminent domain or the imminent threat thereof and the district has 
determined that such property shall be sold, the immediate former owner, or his 
heirs at law or devisees, as the case may be, shall have the first option to 
repurchase the property at the price at which the property was purchased from 
the owner,</P>
<P>c. if any property acquired by the district through the exercise of the power 
of eminent domain or the imminent threat thereof is not needed for immediate 
use, the former owner, or his heirs at law or devisees, as the case may be, 
shall have first option to lease the property until such time as the property is 
actually needed for district purposes;</P>
<P>16. Make surveys;</P>

<P>21. Upon vote of the electors, borrow money and issue special assessment 
bonds or notes, in such principal amounts as do not exceed the maximum amount 
voted by the electors. All such bonds or notes may bear interest at such fixed 
or variable rate or rates, in any combination, as may be determined by the 
directors of the district. Provided, the average coupon rate thereon shall in no 
event exceed fourteen percent (14%) per annum;</P>
<P>22. Appoint committees of electors to undertake studies and report to the 
board upon any issue germane to the operations and management of the district; 
and</P>
<P>23. Generally perform all such acts as shall be necessary to conduct the 
affairs of the district.</P>
<P>D. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect or 
supercede any laws of this state relating to the authority or the jurisdiction 
of any agency of this state or political subdivision of this state to implement 
their respective duties pursuant to law, but shall be held and construed as 
auxiliary and supplementary thereto.</P></FONT></FONT>
