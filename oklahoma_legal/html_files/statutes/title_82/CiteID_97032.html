<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The reclassification of land within any irrigation 
district now or hereafter organized under the provisions of the Oklahoma 
Irrigation District Act, may be changed in the manner prescribed by this 
section. Such reclassification shall not impair or affect the irrigation 
district's organization, or its rights in or to property or any of its rights or 
privileges of whatsoever kind or nature, nor shall it affect, impair or 
discharge any contract, obligation, lien or charge for or upon which it or the 
owner of lands therein were or might become liable or chargeable had such 
reclassification not been made.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The holder or holders of title or evidence of 
title of any body of land situated within the boundaries of any irrigation 
district, may file with the board a petition in writing, requesting that such 
land be reclassified. The petition shall describe the tracts or body of land 
owned by the petitioners. The petition shall be deemed to give the assent of the 
petitioners to the reclassification in said district of the lands described in 
the petition and such petition shall be acknowledged in the same manner that 
conveyances of land are required to be acknowledged.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. 1. Upon the filing of a petition for 
reclassification and payment, by the petitioners to the secretary-treasurer, of 
sufficient monies to pay the costs of all proceedings on the petition, the 
secretary-treasurer of the district shall cause notice of such petition to be 
published once in a newspaper published in the county where the office of the 
directors is situated. If any portion of said district or land lies within 
another county or counties then said notice shall be published in a newspaper 
published within each of said counties. The notice shall inform the public 
of:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the filing of such petition,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the description of the lands mentioned in said 
petition which are desired to be reclassified in the district,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. the reason for reclassification, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. a meeting at which all persons interested may 
appear at the office of the board at the time named in said notice and show 
cause, if any, why said petition should be granted or denied.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The directors shall consider the petition at any 
regular or special meeting of the board and at the established office and place 
of business of the district upon a date not earlier than ten (10) days after the 
publication of the notice.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. A copy of the notice, as published, shall be by 
the secretary-treasurer of the district mailed to each and all of the then 
owners of the tracts or parcels of land proposed to be reclassified. The notice 
shall be so mailed not later than ten (10) days prior to the date set for the 
hearing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The board at the time and place mentioned in the 
notice shall proceed to hear and consider any written comments which may have 
theretofore been filed by any person interested in said petition for 
reclassification, and arguments, if any, by persons interested, in support or 
opposition to the petition.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. 1. If, after giving due consideration, the board 
determines that:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the reclassification is not in the best interest 
of the district,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the reclassification will impair the current or 
future needs of the then existing electors, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. the land is not irrigable, not suitable for 
irrigation or not otherwise necessary for the irrigation district, the board 
shall, by resolution, order that the petition be denied. The resolution shall be 
included in the minutes of the regular or special meeting of the board held for 
such purpose.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If, after giving due consideration, the board 
determines that:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the reclassification is in the best interest of 
the district,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the reclassification will not impair the current 
or future needs of the existing electors, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. the land is irrigable, is suitable for irrigation 
or is otherwise necessary for the irrigation district, the board shall, by 
resolution, reclassify the lands mentioned in the petition or determine that 
some defined portion thereof be reclassified. The resolution shall be included 
in the minutes of the regular or special meeting of the board held for such 
purpose.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If, within thirty (30) days from the making of 
such determination, three-fourths (3/4) of the qualified electors of the 
district, in writing to the board, protest against the determination of the 
board, such determination shall be void.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. 1. When the reclassification of land is commenced 
by petition, the board to whom such petition is presented may require as a 
condition precedent to the granting of the same that the petitioners severally 
pay to the district such respective sums, as nearly as the same can be estimated 
by the board, as the petitioners or their grantors would have been required to 
pay for:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. their pro rata share of all bonds and the interest 
thereon which may have previously thereto been issued by said district had the 
lands been included in the district at the time the same was originally formed 
or when the bonds were so issued, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. irrigation works or water rights purchased other 
than by issue of bonds.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The board shall prepare an itemized expenditure 
listing of such costs incurred which shall also include information detailing 
how any such estimated sums were determined.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. 1. Upon the reclassification of land in the 
district and if no protest has been filed with the board within thirty (30) days 
after the entry of said resolution as provided in subsection E of this section, 
a certified copy of the minutes of the board making such change, and a plat of 
such district showing such change, certified by the president or chairman and 
secretary-treasurer, shall be filed for record in the office of the county clerk 
of each county in which the lands of the district are situated. The district 
shall remain an irrigation district as fully to all intents and purposes as if 
the lands which were reclassified in the district had been included or excluded 
at the organization of the district. The district as so changed and all the 
lands therein shall be liable for all existing obligations and indebtedness of 
the organized district.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Upon filing of the copies of the minutes and the 
plat, copies thereof, certified by said county clerk, shall be admissible in 
evidence to prove the reclassification of said lands in the district.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. 1. Lands within the boundaries of the district may 
also be reclassified by resolution of the board. Notice of the resolution to 
reclassify shall be given in the same manner as if the reclassification were by 
petition of the landowners except that the district shall bear all costs of 
publication and of the proceedings. The board at the time and place mentioned in 
the notice shall proceed to hear and consider any written objections which may 
have theretofore been filed by any person interested in the reclassification, 
and arguments, if any, by persons interested in support or opposition to the 
resolution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The board shall give the same consideration 
required by subsection E of this section for determining whether the lands 
specified in the resolution should be reclassified. If, after the proceeding 
provided by this section, the board determines that the lands specified in the 
resolution should be reclassified, the board shall adopt the resolution. The 
resolution shall be included in the minutes of any regular or special meeting of 
the directors held for such purpose.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If, within thirty (30) days from the meeting of 
such determination, three-fourths (3/4) of the qualified electors of the 
district protest in writing to the board against the reclassification, the 
reclassification shall be void.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If any owner of the property reclassified pursuant 
to this subsection disputes the reclassification of such land, the owner may 
appeal the decision of the district court of the county having jurisdiction over 
the lands specified by the resolution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. In case of reclassification of any lands by 
proceedings under this section, the board shall, at least thirty (30) days prior 
to the next succeeding regular election, make an order redividing such district 
for the purpose of electing directors to ensure equality in land area and number 
of electors.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. In case of the reclassification of any lands by 
proceedings under this section, the owners of the reclassified lands if they are 
to become assessable irrigable lands shall pay the reasonable costs of 
construction necessary to commence water delivery to said 
lands.</FONT></P><B><I>
