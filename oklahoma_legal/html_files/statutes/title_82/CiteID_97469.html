<P>A. All persons engaged in the commercial drilling or commercial plugging of 
groundwater wells, monitoring wells, observation wells, wells utilized for heat 
exchange purposes, including but not limited to heat pump wells and geothermal 
wells, and in the commercial drilling or plugging of geotechnical borings and 
all persons engaged in the commercial installation of water well pumps in this 
state shall make application for and become licensed with the Oklahoma Water 
Resources Board. Persons required to be licensed pursuant to this section shall 
pay an annual fee as required by the Board. The fees shall be deposited and 
expended as provided in subsection D of this section.</P>
<P>B. The Board may prepare examinations and establish other requirements for 
applicants to obtain, maintain, and renew licenses and operator certifications. 
The examinations shall test the knowledge and skills of:</P>
<P>1. Water well drillers in the construction, alteration, and repair of wells 
and boreholes, including proper sealing and abandonment of wells and boreholes, 
and the rules promulgated by the Board regarding water well and borehole 
drilling and plugging; and</P>
<P>2. Pump installers in the planning, installation, operation, and repair of 
pumping equipment and water wells including sealing and abandonment, pumping 
efficiency, and the rules promulgated by the Board regarding pump 
installation.</P>
<P>C. The Board may inspect any water well, monitoring well, boring, water well 
pump, or abandoned well and borehole. Upon consent of the owner of the land on 
which the well or borehole is located or as allowed by district court order, 
authorized representatives of the Board may enter upon and shall be given access 
to the premises for the purpose of inspection. If the Board finds noncompliance 
with applicable laws or rules or that a health hazard exists, the Board may 
disapprove use of the well and shall provide notice to the owner of the land on 
which the well is located and to the well driller, if known, of the disapproval. 
If a well has been disapproved, it shall not be used until brought into 
compliance and any health hazard is eliminated. Any person aggrieved by the 
disapproval of a well may request a hearing before the Board.</P>
<P>D. 1. There is hereby created within the Oklahoma Water Resources Board the 
Well Drillers and Pump Installers Remedial Action Indemnity Fund. The Indemnity 
Fund shall be administered by the Board.</P>
<P>2. The Indemnity Fund shall be excluded from budget and expenditure 
limitations. Except as otherwise provided by subsection E of this section, the 
monies deposited in the Indemnity Fund shall at no time become part of the 
general budget of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board or any other state agency. 
Except as otherwise provided by subsection E of this section, no monies from the 
Indemnity Fund shall be transferred for any purpose to any other state agency or 
any account of the Board or be used for the purpose of contracting with any 
other state agency or reimbursing any other state agency for any expenses. 
Monies in the Indemnity Fund shall only be expended for remedial actions 
necessary, without notice and hearing, to protect groundwater from pollution or 
potential pollution from wells, or boreholes under the jurisdiction of the Board 
that do not meet minimum standards for construction or that have been abandoned 
or as may be recommended by the Well Drillers and Pump Installers Advisory 
Council.</P>
<P>3. The fees collected pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be first 
credited to the Well Drillers and Pump Installers Remedial Action Indemnity 
Fund. The Indemnity Fund shall be maintained at Fifty Thousand Dollars 
($50,000.00).</P>
<P>4. Expenditures from the Indemnity Fund required pursuant to the provisions 
of this section shall be made pursuant to the provisions of The Oklahoma Central 
Purchasing Act upon terms and conditions established by the Office of Management 
and Enterprise Services and shall not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) 
for each well, borehole or pump for which action is taken.</P>
<P>5. Except in situations where the Board has assessed and declared a health or 
safety emergency and a claim by the owner of the well or borehole for costs of 
remedial action is not paid by private insurance or other relief, the Board 
shall seek reimbursement as recommended by the Well Drillers and Pump Installers 
Advisory Council for any remedial action taken or required by the Board. Any 
monies received as reimbursement shall be deposited in the Well Drillers and 
Pump Installers Remedial Action Indemnity Fund except as otherwise provided in 
subsection C of this section.</P>
<P>E. When the Well Drillers and Pump Installers Remedial Action Indemnity Fund 
reaches Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), the fees, monies received as 
reimbursement, and administrative penalties recovered under paragraph 1 of 
subsection G of this section shall be deposited in a separate account in the 
Water Resources Board Revolving Fund designated as the Well Drillers and Pump 
Installers Regulation Account, which shall be a continuing account not subject 
to fiscal year limitations. Monies in said account shall be used by the Board 
for inspections, licensing, enforcement and education, reimbursing per diem and 
travel costs for members of the Well Drillers and Pump Installers Advisory 
Council pursuant to the State Travel Reimbursement Act, and as otherwise 
determined to be necessary to implement the provisions of this section.</P>
<P>F. Before any person or firm licensed pursuant to this section shall commence 
the commercial drilling or plugging of any well or borehole or commence 
commercial installation of any pump, the person or firm shall file with the 
Board all data or information as the Board may by rule require to assure the 
protection of the groundwater in the well or borehole. After completion, the 
driller shall file a completion report showing all such data together with a log 
of the well and pumping test data if applicable.</P>
<P>G. 1. The Board may, after notice and hearing, impose on any person 
administrative penalties of up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) and may 
revoke, suspend or deny renewal of any license or operator certification for 
each violation of the rules of the Board regarding license or certification 
requirements, the requirement to obtain a license or certification, or minimum 
construction or installation standards. The administrative penalties shall be 
deposited in the Well Drillers and Pump Installers Remedial Action Indemnity 
Fund except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this section.</P>
<P>2. In addition to imposing administrative penalties, the Board may issue 
orders prohibiting actions by holders of valid licenses and operator 
certifications and by persons who are required to become licensed under the 
provisions of this section that constitute violations of rules promulgated 
pursuant to this section and requiring actions to remedy violations or other 
noncompliance with minimum standards rules for the construction of wells and 
borings, the plugging of wells and borings, and the commercial installation of 
water well pumps.</P>
<P>H. If a respondent fails, refuses or neglects to comply with an order of the 
Board to pay an administrative penalty or to take certain action, the Board may 
present the matter to the Attorney General who is empowered to take action to 
collect the administrative penalty or to compel compliance with the order of the 
Board. One-half (1/2) of all penalties collected by the Attorney General shall 
be deposited in the Well Drillers and Pump Installers Regulation Account 
established pursuant to subsection E of this section and one-half (1/2) shall be 
deposited in the Attorney General's Revolving Fund created in Section 20 of 
Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P>I. The Board is authorized to create a Well Drillers and Pump Installers 
Advisory Council. The Board shall establish rules stating the qualifications for 
membership and organization of the Council. Meetings of the Council shall be 
held at the call of the Executive Director of the Board. The Council shall have 
the following duties:</P>
<P>1. To recommend rules to the Board, provided such written recommendations 
have been concurred upon by a majority of the membership of the Council; and</P>
<P>2. To review and recommend approval or denial of use of monies in the Well 
Drillers and Pump Installers Remedial Action Indemnity Fund for:</P>
<P>a. remedial actions to protect groundwater from pollution or potential 
pollution from wells, or boreholes under the jurisdiction of the Board which do 
not meet minimum standards for construction or that have been abandoned, and</P>
<P>b. inspections, licensing, the pursuit of enforcement action with the proper 
authorities and education by the Board.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>
