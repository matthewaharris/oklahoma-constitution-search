<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. In the case of a tie vote on any of the Commission's determinations, order, or other actions, a majority of the Commissioners of either state may, upon written request to the Chairman, submit the question to arbitration. Arbitration shall not be compulsory, but on the event of arbitration, there shall be three arbitrators:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the arbitrators fail to select a third within sixty (60) days following their selection, then he shall be chosen by the Chairman of the Commission.</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. The salaries and personal expenses of each Commissioner shall be paid by the Government which he represents. All other expenses which are incurred by the Commission incident to the administration of this Compact shall be borne equally by the two states and shall be paid by the Commission out of the "Arkansas-Oklahoma Arkansas River Compact Fund," initiated and maintained as provided in Article IX(B)(5) below. The states hereby mutually agree to appropriate sums sufficient to cover its share of the expenses incurred in the administration of this Compact, to be paid into said fund. Disbursements shall be made from said fund in such manner as may be authorized by the Commission. Such funds shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedures of the states; however, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited by a qualified independent public accountant at regular intervals, and the report of such audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the Commission, provided by Article IX(B)(6) below. The Commission shall not pledge the credit of either state and shall not incur any obligations prior to the availability of funds adequate to meet the same.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(7) Hold hearings and compel the attendance of witnesses for the purpose of taking testimony and receiving other appropriate and proper evidence and issuing such appropriate orders as it deems necessary for the proper administration of this Compact, which orders shall be enforceable upon the request by the Commission or any other interested party in any court of competent jurisdiction within the county wherein the subject matter to which the order relates is in existence, subject to the right of review through the appellate courts of the State of situs.

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(8) Make and file official certified copies of any of its findings, recommendations or reports with such officers or agencies of either state, or the United States, as may have any interest in or jurisdiction over the subject matter. Findings of fact made by the Commission shall be admissible in evidence and shall constitute prima facie evidence of such fact in any court or before any agency of competent jurisdiction. The making of findings, recommendations, or reports by the Commission shall not be a condition precedent to instituting or maintaining any action or proceeding of any kind by a signatory state in any court, or before any tribunal, agency or officer, for the protection of any right under this Compact or for the enforcement of any of its provisions;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(9) Secure from the head of any department or agency of the federal or state government such information, suggestions, estimates and statistics as it may need or believe to be useful for carrying out its functions and as may be available to or procurable by the department or agency to which the request is addressed; (10) Print or otherwise reproduce and distribute all of its proceedings and reports; and (11) Accept, for the purposes of this Compact, any and all private donations and gifts and Federal grants of money.</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The Commission shall:</FONT></P>
