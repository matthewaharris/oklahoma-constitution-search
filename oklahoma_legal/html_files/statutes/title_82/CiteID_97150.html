<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. There is hereby authorized the formation of conservancy districts within 
this state. Each such district shall be designated as a "conservancy district" 
or "master conservancy district". Such districts shall not be political 
corporations or subdivisions of the state. All of the provisions of this chapter 
shall apply to all such districts except insofar as special provisions shall be 
made herein relating to master conservancy districts only. All provisions of 
this chapter prescribing the contents of pleadings or instruments and using the 
term "conservancy district" may be modified to use the term "master conservancy 
district", when the same shall be applicable. Provided that in the event a 
master conservancy district is organized, the obligation including the area of a 
conservancy district shall become the obligation of the master conservancy 
district to the extent such obligations relate to water resources development 
and control.</P>
<P>B. 1. The district court of any judicial district in this state, or any judge 
thereof when said court is in vacation, is vested with jurisdiction, power and 
authority, when the conditions stated in <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=97154">Section 542 of this title</A> are found 
to exist, to establish conservancy districts, which may be entirely within, or 
partly within and partly without, the judicial district in which said court is 
located, for all or any of these purposes:</P>
<P>a. of preventing floods,</P>
<P>b. of regulating stream channels by changing, widening and deepening 
same,</P>
<P>c. of reclaiming or of filling wet and overflowed land,</P>
<P>d. of providing for irrigation where it may be needed,</P>
<P>e. of regulating the flow of streams,</P>
<P>f. of diverting or in whole or in part eliminating watercourses, or part of 
the flowage thereof, or</P>
<P>g. of developing and providing water for domestic, industrial and 
agricultural requirements, and to persons within the territory of the district. 
This also may include the construction, operation and maintenance of storage, 
distribution, treatment, supply and other works, installation, improvements and 
facilities necessary or incidental thereto. Provided, that no conservancy 
district shall construct, operate or maintain distribution facilities within the 
limits of any municipal corporation.</P>
<P>2. Incident to any purpose provided in this subsection, and to further enable 
their accomplishment, a master conservancy district may:</P>
<P>a. straighten, widen, deepen, divert or change the course or terminus of any 
natural or artificial watercourse,</P>
<P>b. build or rebuild reservoirs, canals, levees, walls, embankments, bridges, 
or dams,</P>
<P>c. maintain, operate and repair any of the construction herein named, and</P>
<P>d. do all other things necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes of this 
chapter.</P>
<P>C. Master conservancy districts may be created to include lands constituting 
all or any part of the area of one or more conservancy and/or irrigation 
districts and/or municipal corporations and/or lands not included in any such 
area or areas. Provided, however, that no conservancy district nor portion 
thereof shall be incorporated into a master conservancy district without the 
consent of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the owners of land and by owners 
of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the land area embraced in the conservancy 
district or that portion thereof to be incorporated into a master conservancy 
district. In addition to any or all of the purposes enumerated in subsection B 
of this section, master conservancy districts may be created for any or all of 
the following purposes:</P>
<P>1. To conduct preliminary surveys and to develop a plan for the comprehensive 
control, regulation and/or use of water from any designated stream, watercourse 
or watercourse system and/or its basin;</P>
<P>2. To coordinate the operations, works and facilities of two or more 
conservancy districts with each other and with improvements, works, and 
facilities of the master conservancy district;</P>
<P>3. To enable the acquisition, construction and maintenance of improvements 
and facilities for common benefit and/or use of constituent areas;</P>
<P>4. To permit two or more municipal corporations and/or conservancy districts 
to pool their resources to effect any or all of the foregoing; and</P>
<P>5. To enter into contracts with municipal corporations, persons and public 
agencies for the furnishing to them of water, subject, however, to the proviso 
in subparagraph g of paragraph 1 of subsection B of this section.</P>
<P>D. 1. Immediately following organization of a master conservancy district, 
the first board of directors shall be appointed by the district judge and shall 
consist of such number of persons as the district judge shall designate to 
provide equitable representation for the component areas and/or for users 
contracting for a substantial service from the district, and said directors 
shall serve until their successors have been selected and qualified. At the 
first meeting the directors shall elect a president, vice-president, secretary 
and treasurer from their number, and shall adopt bylaws for the governing of the 
business of the district, subject to approval by the district judge, and attend 
to such other business as may come before said board. The president shall be the 
chief executive officer of the district, shall preside at the meetings of the 
board and shall perform all other functions which are necessary and proper for 
carrying out the provisions of this act, subject to approval of the board. The 
vice-president shall act as president whenever the president is absent, or 
otherwise incapacitated, or fails to act. The secretary shall be custodian of 
the district seal, attest to the signature of the president when law requires 
that it be attested to and shall be charged with the duty of keeping accurate 
and detailed minutes of meetings of the board. The treasurer shall be custodian 
of all monies, funds and credits of the district and shall keep the books and 
records of the district in proper form.</P>
<P>2. All officers and employees handling funds of a master conservancy district 
shall be bonded in a penal sum of not less than Twenty-five Thousand Dollars 
($25,000.00), such bond to be a corporate surety bond approved by the judge of 
the district court establishing the district, for the faithful performance of 
their duties. The bond premiums shall be paid by the district and benefits 
accrue to said district.</P>
<P>3. All officers and employees shall execute the customary oath of office, 
which shall be filed with the secretary of the district.</P>
<P>4. Within two (2) years after the first board of directors has been appointed 
by the district judge, the district judge shall appoint members to the board as 
hereinafter provided and fix the total number of such directors for equitable 
representation. Provided, however, each component area, including municipal 
corporations, cities, towns, irrigation districts, and users contracting for a 
substantial service from the district may elect their respective representation 
to the board of directors.</P>
<P>5. Each component area, including municipal corporations, cities, towns, 
irrigation districts, and users contracting for a substantial service from the 
district shall be entitled to representation on the board of directors, in 
accordance with the ratio which their individual, actual and contingent water 
storage for which it has contractual obligations to the master conservancy 
district bears to the total water storage for which there are contractual 
obligations with said district. In fixing the number of directors to represent a 
master conservancy district, each component area or user contracting for a 
substantial service from the district shall be entitled to at least one 
director, but no such area or user shall be entitled to more than three 
directors. The total number of directors and the representation of each such 
area or user may be changed by the district judge whenever a reallocation is 
considered by said judge to be necessary for providing proper representation. 
Provided, however, that if a master conservancy district has been organized on 
or before January 5, 1957, under the provisions of this title, which has as a 
part of its purpose the inclusion of a proposed irrigation district or 
districts, each such proposed district shall be entitled to one representative 
on the board of directors of the master conservancy district for a period of 
five (5) years from the effective date of this act; provided, however, that if 
the proposed irrigation district or districts, as hereinabove described, are not 
legally organized and have not executed a contract for the repayment of the 
irrigation costs with the master conservancy district within the aforementioned 
five-year period, then said offices of directors representing the irrigation 
interests shall be discontinued and shall have no further representation on said 
board of directors; provided, further, that if the proposed irrigation districts 
are organized and have contracted with a master conservancy district under the 
laws of this state, then said directors shall be elected or selected as provided 
in this section pertaining to the second board of directors.</P>
<P>The governing body of each such area or user such as a municipal corporation, 
city, town, irrigation district, conservation district, and/or other user may 
select or cause to be elected the person or persons to represent them on the 
board of directors of the master conservancy district and shall submit the name 
or names of those selected to the district judge who shall appoint said person 
or persons to membership on the board of directors. Only a freeholder who is a 
qualified elector of this state as provided by law and residing within any 
county in which the district or any part thereof is located shall be eligible to 
be a member of the board of directors. A person who is a nonelected employee of 
a municipality that is a component area or a user of a master conservancy 
district shall not be eligible to be a member of the board of directors of that 
district. Any person serving on a board of directors of a master conservancy 
district as of the effective date of this act who is not in compliance with the 
provisions of this paragraph shall be allowed to serve the remainder of his or 
her term of office and shall be eligible for reappointment or re-election to the 
board of directors.</P>
<P>6. Vacancies occurring of unexpired terms of office on the board of directors 
shall be filled through appointment by the district judge upon the 
recommendations of the component area or user authorized to make the original 
selection. The district judge shall determine whether persons who have been 
recommended for appointment hereunder are qualified as provided herein.</P>
<P>7. The board of directors first appointed, and those subsequently appointed, 
or elected, are hereby authorized and empowered to appoint a manager and such 
additional personnel as may be necessary and proper for conducting the business 
of said district; provided, however, that no employee of the district may be a 
member of the board.</P>
<P>8. Upon expiration of the two-year term of office of directors first 
appointed by the district judge, the next succeeding board of directors shall be 
elected or appointed so that as nearly as possible one-half (1/2) of their 
number shall serve a term of two (2) years and the remainder for a term of four 
(4) years. The board of directors shall meet and determine their respective term 
of office by lot. Thereafter, at the expiration of their respective term of 
office, directors shall be elected or appointed for a term of four (4) 
years.</P>
<P>9. On the first Wednesday following each biennial election or appointment of 
the members of the board of directors by the district judge, as the case may be, 
they shall meet and organize as a board and elect officers for service as 
provided above for the first board.</P>
<P>10. The board of directors shall perform official actions by resolution and a 
majority of their number shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any 
and all business of the district. All official actions including final passage 
and enactment of all resolutions must be approved by a majority of the board of 
directors present, a quorum being present, at a regular or special meeting.</P>
<P>11. The board of directors shall hold regular meetings once a month, the date 
thereof to be established in the district's bylaws or by resolution. The 
president or any three members may call such special meetings as may be 
necessary in the administration of the district's business, provided that at 
least five (5) days prior to the meeting date the secretary shall have mailed 
notice thereof to the address which each member shall file with the secretary. 
Notices of special meetings may be waived in writing by any director.</P>
<P>12. Each director shall be reimbursed for all necessary and reasonable 
expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties pursuant to law, as 
provided for in the State Travel Reimbursement Act. In addition to any 
reimbursement for necessary and reasonable expenses received by the director 
pursuant to this paragraph, each director shall be entitled to receive a per 
diem not to exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per meeting for not more than 
two meetings a month.</P>
