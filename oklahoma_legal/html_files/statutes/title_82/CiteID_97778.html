<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARKANSAS-LOUISIANA-OKLAHOMA-TEXAS, 
1978</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>PREAMBLE</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and 
Texas, pursuant to the acts of their respective Governors or Legislatures, or 
both, being moved by considerations of interstate comity, have resolved to 
compact with respect to the water of the Red River and its tributaries. By Act 
of Congress, Public Law No. 346 (84th Congress, First Session), the consent of 
the United States has been granted for said states to negotiate and enter into a 
compact providing for an equitable apportionment of such water; and pursuant to 
that Act the President has designated the representative of the United 
States.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Further, the consent of Congress has been given for 
two or more states to negotiate and enter into agreements relating to water 
pollution control by the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
(P.L. 92-500, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Signatory States acting through their duly 
authorized Compact Commissioners, after several years of negotiations, have 
agreed to an equitable apportionment of the water of the Red River and its 
tributaries and do hereby submit and recommend that this Compact be adopted by 
the respective Legislatures and approved by Congress as hereinafter set 
forth:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE I</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>PURPOSES</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 1.01 The principal purposes of this Compact 
are:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) To promote interstate comity and remove causes of 
controversy between each of the affected states by governing the use, control 
and distribution of the interstate water of the Red River and its 
tributaries;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) To provide an equitable apportionment among the 
Signatory States of the water of the Red River and its tributaries;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) To promote an active program for the control and 
alleviation of natural deterioration and pollution of the water of the Red River 
Basin and to provide for enforcement of the laws related thereto;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) To provide the means for an active program for 
the conservation of water, protection of lives and property from floods, 
improvement of water quality, development of navigation and regulation of flows 
in the Red River Basin; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) To provide a basis for state or joint state 
planning and action by ascertaining and identifying each state's share in the 
interstate water of the Red River Basin and the apportionment 
thereof.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE II</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>GENERAL PROVISIONS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.01 Each Signatory State may use the water 
allocated to it by this Compact in any manner deemed beneficial by that state. 
Each state may freely administer water rights and uses in accordance with the 
laws of that state, but such uses shall be subject to the availability of water 
in accordance with the apportionments made by this Compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.02 The use of water by the United States in 
connection with any individual Federal project shall be in accordance with the 
Act of Congress authorizing the project and the water shall be charged to the 
state or states receiving the benefit therefrom.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.03 Any Signatory State using the channel of 
Red River or its tributaries to convey stored water shall be subject to an 
appropriate reduction in the amount which may be withdrawn at the point of 
removal to account for transmission losses.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.04 The failure of any state to use any 
portion of the water allocated to it shall not constitute relinquishment or 
forfeiture of the right to such use.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.05 Each Signatory State shall have the 
right to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Construct conservation storage capacity for the

recognized or authorized by this Compact made unusable by any cause, including 
losses due to sediment storage;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Construct reservoir storage capacity for the 
purposes of flood and sediment control as well as storage of water which is 
either imported or is to be exported if such storage does not adversely affect 
the delivery of water apportioned to any other Signatory State; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) Use the bed and banks of the Red River and its 
tributaries to convey stored water, imported or exported water, and water 
apportioned according to this Compact.</FONT></P>

those claiming under its authority, in, over and to water of the Red River 
Basin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.08 Nothing in this Compact shall be 
construed to include within the water apportioned by this Compact any water 
consumed in each state by livestock or for domestic purposes; provided, however, 
the storage of such water is in accordance with the laws of the respective 
states but any such impoundment shall not exceed 200 acre-feet, or such smaller 
quantity as may be provided for by the laws of each state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.09 In the event any state shall import 
water into the Red River Basin from any other river basin, the Signatory State 
making the importation shall have the use of such imported water.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.10 Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed 
to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Interfere with or impair the right or power of 
any Signatory State to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use, 
and control of water, or quality of water, not inconsistent with its obligations 
under this Compact;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Repeal or prevent the enactment of any 
legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any Signatory State 
imposing any additional conditions or restrictions to further lessen or prevent 
the pollution or natural deterioration of water within its jurisdiction; 
provided nothing contained in this paragraph shall alter any provisions of this 
Compact dealing with the apportionment of water or the rights thereto; 
or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Waive any state's immunity under the Eleventh 
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, or as constituting the 
consent of any state to be sued by its own citizens.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.11 Accounting for apportionment purposes on 
interstate streams shall not be mandatory under the terms of the Compact until 
one or more affected states deem the accounting necessary.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.12 For the purposes of apportionment of the 
water among the Signatory States, the Red River is hereby divided into the 
following major subdivisions:</FONT></P>

New Mexico-Texas state boundary to Denison Dam;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) Reach V - that portion of the Red River and 
tributaries in Louisiana not included in Reach III or in Reach IV.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.13 If any part or application of this 
Compact shall be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, all 
other severable provisions and applications of this Compact shall remain in full 
force and effect.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 2.14 Subject to the availability of water in 
accordance with this Compact, nothing in this Compact shall be held or construed

recognize that the control and abatement of the naturally-occurring salinity 
sources as well as, under certain circumstances, the maintenance and enhancement 
of the quality of water in the Red River Basin may require the cooperative 
action of all states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SECTION 11.03 The Signatory States agree to cooperate
