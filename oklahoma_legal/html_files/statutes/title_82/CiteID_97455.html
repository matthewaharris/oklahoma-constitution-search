<P>A. It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this state, in the 
interest of the agricultural stability, domestic, municipal, industrial and 
other beneficial uses, general economy, health and welfare of the state and its 
citizens, to utilize the ground water resources of the state, and for that 
purpose to provide reasonable regulations for the allocation for reasonable use 
based on hydrologic surveys of fresh ground water basins or subbasins to 
determine a restriction on the production, based upon the acres overlying the 
ground water basin or subbasin.</P>
<P>B. The provisions of Section <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=97454">1020.1</A> et seq. of this title shall 
not apply to the taking, using or disposal of salt water associated with the 
exploration, production or recovery of oil and gas. The provisions of this act 
shall not apply to the taking, using or disposal of water trapped in producing 
mines outside of a sensitive sole source groundwater basin or subbasin.</P>
<P>C. Except as provided for in subsection E of this section, the provisions of 
this act shall not apply to the taking, using or disposal of water trapped in 
producing mines:</P>
<P>1. That overlie a sensitive sole source groundwater basin or subbasin and 
have been permitted by the Oklahoma Department of Mines as of August 1, 
2011;</P>
<P>2. That overlie a sensitive sole source groundwater basin or subbasin for 
which an initial application for a permit shall have been filed with the 
Oklahoma Department of Mines as of August 1, 2011; or</P>
<P>3. That overlie a sensitive sole source groundwater basin or subbasin and for 
which a permit revision is approved by the Oklahoma Department of Mines.</P>
<P>Provided that the use of mine pit water, pursuant to a site-specific water 
management and conservation plan prepared in consultation with the Oklahoma 
Water Resources Board, by mines that are exempted from this act by the terms of 
this subsection and in furtherance of mine operations and associated 
manufacturing and commercial activities on the mine site, shall be considered as 
permitted beneficial uses for all purposes under the laws of the state.</P>
<P>D. 1. Except with respect to the mines exempted from the terms of this act 
under subsections B and C of this section, the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, 
in coordination with the Oklahoma Department of Mines, shall promulgate rules 
for the taking, using or disposal of water collecting in producing mine pits and 
emanating from a sensitive sole source groundwater basin or subbasin.</P>
<P>2. The rules promulgated by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board shall require, 
subject to a de minimis exemption to be promulgated therein, the development by 
the mine operator of provisions relating to the augmentation (a beneficial use) 
of stream flow or groundwater, and of site-specific water management and 
conservation plans, which plans shall establish threshold hydrologic monitoring, 
management and mitigation requirements that are based on relevant hydrologic 
surveys and investigations of the sensitive sole source groundwater basin or 
subbasin. Such plans submitted to the Oklahoma Water Resources Board shall be 
subject to the provisions of the Oklahoma Open Records Act.</P>
<P>3. The rules promulgated by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board shall contain 
provisions relating to augmentation of stream flow or groundwater, or both, to 
offset consumptive use of groundwater collecting in the producing mine pit that 
emanates from a sensitive sole source groundwater basin or subbasin in amounts 
greater than the equal proportionate share of the maximum annual yield of the 
groundwater basin or subbasin established by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board 
that may be allocated to the owner or operator of the producing mine based on 
groundwater rights owned or leased by the owner or operator.</P>
<P>E. 1. By no later than January 1, 2013, the operator of a mine that is 
exempted from this act by the provisions of subsection C of this section shall 
adopt and implement a plan to monitor and report to the Board the accumulation 
and disposition of pit water during the previous calendar year. The operator 
shall also file with the Board interim quarterly reports containing information 
about the accumulation and disposition of pit water during the previous quarter. 
The first interim quarterly report for calendar year 2013 shall be sent to the 
Board by June 30, 2013, and the annual report for the calendar year 2013 shall 
be sent to the Board by March 31, 2014. Thereafter, the annual report for each 
calendar year shall be sent to the Board by March 31st of the following year. 
The monitoring plan will provide for the measurement or reasonable estimation of 
groundwater and surface water volumes, separately stated, entering the pit, of 
the water diverted from the pit, of the disposition of the water from the pit, 
and of the consumptive use, as defined in this section, of the mine pit water by 
the mine operator. The reports received by the Board will be subject to the 
provisions of the Oklahoma Open Records Act. If an operator of a mine that is 
exempted from this act by the provisions of subsection C of this section fails 
to timely submit an interim quarterly report or annual report, the exemption of 
subsection C shall no longer apply to the mine and the rules promulgated 
pursuant to subsection D of this section shall become applicable, provided that 
such rules shall contain provisions to allow the operator to show cause why the 
exemption contained in subsection C of this section should continue to 
apply.</P>
<P>2. If, at any time after March 31, 2015, the amount of groundwater from the 
pit (plus amounts of groundwater from permitted wells, if any) consumptively 
used in the preceding twelve months by the mine operator at a mine described in 
paragraph 1 of this subsection exceeds the annual amount that is equivalent to 
the equal proportionate share of the maximum annual yield of the groundwater 
basin or subbasin that could be allocated to the owner or operator of the 
producing mine based on groundwater rights owned or leased by the owner or 
operator, then the exemption of subsection C of this section shall no longer 
apply and the provisions of subsection D of this section shall become applicable 
to the mine unless the mine operator submits a site-specific water management 
and conservation plan demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the Board, that such 
consumptive use of groundwater in amounts greater than the equivalent equal 
proportionate share either is:</P>
<P>a. offset by augmentation of stream water flow or augmentation of groundwater 
by recharge, or</P>
<P>b. not likely to reduce the natural flow of springs or streams emanating from 
a sensitive sole source groundwater basin or subbasin, or</P>
<P>c. satisfied by the owner or operator acquiring sufficient groundwater rights 
within ninety (90) days of the reported exceedance.</P>
<P>The plan submitted to the Board will be subject to the provisions of the 
Oklahoma Open Records Act. If the exemption of subsection C of this section no 
longer applies, the rules promulgated by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board 
pursuant to subsection D of this section shall provide a period of at least 
ninety (90) days to come into compliance.</P>
<P>3. If an operator of a mine that is exempt pursuant to subsection C of this 
section operates in compliance with a site-specific water management and 
conservation plan that complies with rules promulgated by the Board pursuant to 
subsection D of this section, the Board cannot otherwise require the operator of 
such mine to take an action or refrain from taking an action that would 
effectively prohibit any mining operation or practice that is otherwise allowed 
by the Oklahoma Department of Mines.</P>
<P>F. For purposes of this section, "consumptive use" or "consumptively used" 
means diversion of water from a mine pit that is not returned to the groundwater 
basin or subbasin, or to a mine pit or holding basin, or to a definite stream, 
or to the land surface from which surface runoff flows into a mine pit. The term 
"consumptive use" includes the estimated moisture content driven off or carried 
away with the mined material transported off the mining site, plus the amount of 
evaporation from the mine pit that exceeds the amount of direct precipitation 
and surface runoff into the mine pit, plus any amounts for other proposed 
beneficial uses off the mining site.</P>
<P>G. Augmentation of stream flow or groundwater, pursuant to a site-specific 
water management and conservation plan prepared in consultation with the 
Oklahoma Water Resources Board, shall be considered a beneficial use and not 
waste, and shall not count against permitted surface water or groundwater usage, 
provided that taking, using or disposal of water from a producing mine for 
stream augmentation pursuant to a site-specific water management and 
conservation plan prepared in consultation with the Oklahoma Water Resources 
Board, may be claimed in annual water use reports as a beneficial use for 
purposes of the maintenance of the right to use surface water under any permit 
applicable to such mine. The mine pit shall be considered a diversion point 
authorized by the surface water use permit issued to the mine operator whenever 
there is consumptive use of surface water or the surface water is used for 
stream augmentation.</P>
