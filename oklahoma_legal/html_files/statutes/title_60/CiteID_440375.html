<P><FONT size=2>A. No public trust, school district or county shall issue any 
bonds, notes, certificates of participation, certificates of indebtedness or any 
other evidence of indebtedness, excluding nonpayable warrants and agreements 
with a depository bank to honor payment of checks when there are insufficient 
funds, for the purpose of short-term cash management by any school district or 
county unless such school district or county shall have been approved for 
participation by the Oklahoma Commission on School and County Funds 
Management.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>As used in this section, "short-term cash management" means any 
borrowing or any method employed by a school district or county to obtain funds 
in advance of the receipt of tax revenue, and shall include, but not be limited 
to, the issuance of certificates of indebtedness, certificates of participation, 
tax-anticipation notes, bonds, notes, or any other evidence of indebtedness. It 
shall not include debt issued pursuant to a vote of the electors of the school 
district or county pursuant to the Constitution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>B. The Oklahoma Commission on School and County Funds 
Management, shall consist of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the 
Director of the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education, and the 
State Bond Advisor. The Commission shall:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>1. Receive requests of school districts and counties for 
authorization to participate in a short-term cash management program where the 
proceeds will be used to facilitate cash-flow management. The requests must be 
received by the Commission on or before April 1 in order for the school district 
or county to be considered for participation during the next fiscal year, unless 
such date is extended by the Commission;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>2. Within five (5) business days of receiving a request, forward 
the request to the appropriate certifying authority. If the request and 
accompanying material meet the requirements of this act, the certifying 
authority must return the request and accompanying information to the Commission 
with a written review and comment within sixty (60) days of receipt of the 
request from the Commission. The certifying authority for school districts shall 
be the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and for technology center 
school districts, shall be the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Career and 
Technology Education and for counties, shall be the State Board of 
Equalization;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>3. Approve or reject each request for participation, and forward 
notice of the decision of the Commission to the requesting school district or 
county and to the Office of the Governor. The Commission shall approve or reject 
a request within thirty (30) days following the date it receives the request and 
accompanying information with a written review and comment from a certifying 
authority;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>4. Certify the need for funds generated by the proposed 
short-term cash management based on the financial projections of the school 
district or county, including the projected cash-flow shortfall, estimated 
income, and anticipated surplus balances on June 30 of the current fiscal year 
in the general and building funds of the school district or county. Accumulative 
cash-flow shortfall projections must be determined using the method specified by 
Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>5. Establish reasonable limits for fees, commissions and other 
compensation paid to any person or firm involved with the proposed short-term 
cash management program;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>6. Establish participation limitations for a school district or 
a county using the method specified in Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
No school district or county shall participate in a short-term cash management 
program in an amount which exceeds the determination of need pursuant to the 
accumulative cash-flow projections as specified in paragraph 4 of this 
subsection or forty percent (40%) of the approved annual budget of the school 
district or county, whichever is less;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>7. Establish limitations which prohibit school districts and 
counties which are participating in a short-term cash management program from 
issuing nonpayable warrants if proceeds are available from the short-term cash 
management program;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>8. Submit an annual report, by December 15 of each year, to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of the 
Senate, the Governor, the State Auditor and Inspector and the Attorney General, 
detailing the participation of each school district and county for the prior 
fiscal year in the short-term cash management programs authorized by this act; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>9. Prescribe methods and procedures by which school districts or 
counties may request authorization to participate in short-term cash management 
programs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>C. School districts and counties desiring to participate in a 
short-term cash management program as provided in subsection A of this section 
shall file a request with the Commission on such forms as the Commission shall 
prescribe. Such request shall be accompanied by:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>1. A resolution adopted by the board of education of the school 
district or by the county commissioners of a county. Such resolution shall state 
that the school district or county intends to and has need to participate in a 
short-term cash management program and that the board of education or county 
commission has authorized the submission of such request;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>2. A letter signed by the underwriter of the short-term cash 
management program that specifies the name and address of all persons and firms 
receiving compensation, directly or indirectly, involved with the proposed 
short-term cash management program. All persons and firms designated shall not 
be paid out of school or county funds. For purposes of this paragraph, school or 
county funds shall not include the proceeds from certificates of indebtedness or 
certificates of participation generated from a short-term cash management 
program;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>3. A verification from the Administrator of the Oklahoma 
Department of Securities that all persons receiving compensation, directly or 
indirectly, for providing advice to the school districts or counties concerning 
participation in the program or for endorsing participation in the program are 
appropriately registered with the Oklahoma Department of Securities as 
investment advisers or investment adviser representatives, as applicable, and 
that all persons receiving compensation, directly or indirectly, for the 
placement of the certificates of participation or like securities with investors 
are registered as broker-dealers or agents, as applicable;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>4. The estimated income and expenditures of the school district 
or county for the year for which the school district or county wishes to 
participate in a short-term cash management program. The appropriate certifying 
authority shall develop and provide an income and expenditure disclosure form 
for use by a school district or county which desires to participate in a 
short-term cash management program which follows the applicable portions of the 
information return required by Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code. The 
information supplied in the disclosure form must reflect the ability of the 
school district or county to pay off an amount equal to the district's or 
county's liability on the program from the income from the fiscal year of 
participation, prior to approval for participation by the Commission. If the 
Commission determines that a question exists concerning any information 
submitted pursuant to this subsection, the Commission may request any additional 
information from the school district or county that it deems 
necessary;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>5. A copy of the most recent information return for a short-term 
cash management program filed with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to

enterprises of any kind which provide services for compensation on any financing 
to implement a short-term cash management program, which shall be signed under 
oath on a form approved by the Commission and which shall state that such 
persons, firms, corporations or business enterprises have not given any money or 
other thing of value, other than a bona fide campaign contribution, to any 
public official or to any public employee of a school district or county 
participating in such a cash management program. Any such person, firm, 
corporation or business enterprise shall also file a disclosure statement on a 
form approved by the Commission, which shall disclose all campaign contributions 
of any kind made to any public official of a school district or county 
participating in such a short-term cash management program and shall also 
disclose the identity of any officer, director, agent or employee of such 
person, firm, corporation or business enterprise who is an officer or employee 
of a school or county participating in a short-term cash management program, or 
who is related to such officers or employees within the third degree of affinity 
or consanguinity;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>7. A notarized sworn affidavit executed by each member of a 
board of education of a school district, the superintendent of schools and the 
treasurer of the school district or by each county commissioner of a county and 
the county treasurer, which states that the person or any member of the 
immediate family of the person has no direct or indirect financial interest in 
the short-term cash management program being requested. The affidavit shall be 
on a form prescribed by the Commission;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>8. A summary report detailing all expenses incurred by a school 
district or county in participating in a short-term cash management program. The 
report shall be on a form prescribed by the Commission; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>9. Any application and other materials including any other 
necessary financial information, as may be required by the 
Commission.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>D. If the information required to be submitted pursuant to this 
section meets all requirements established by the Commission and the Commission 
has approved such information and participation, and the participation is 
otherwise in accordance with law, the Oklahoma Commission on School and County 
Funds Management shall authorize the participation of the school district or 
county in the short-term cash management program. The Commission shall notify 
the school district or county in writing, whether the requirements of this 
section have been satisfied and approved.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>E. School districts and counties participating in a short-term 
cash management program authorized by this section shall report to the 
Commission the probable income and expenses of anticipated investment income. 
The report shall not include probable income or expenses related to

<P><FONT size=2>F. The ability of a school district or county to issue general 
obligation bonds shall not be modified by this act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>G. The Office of the Attorney General shall provide legal
