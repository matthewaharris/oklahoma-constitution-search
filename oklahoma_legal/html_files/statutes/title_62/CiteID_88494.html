<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><strong><em>Multiple Amendments Enacted During the 2021 Legislative Session</em></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><strong>Version 1 (as amended by </strong></span><strong>Laws 2021, SB 1049, c. 203, § 11, emerg. eff. April 23, 2021)</strong></p>

<p>A.  No State Governmental Entity or Local Governmental Entity shall issue any State Governmental Entity Financing obligations unless such obligations have been approved by the Council of Bond Oversight as provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=88491">Section 695.8</a> of this title; provided, however, that in no event shall the Councils approval be required for the issuance of any obligations pursuant to a remarketing or a change in interest rate or maturity under the terms of indentures or agreements securing obligations heretofore issued prior to July 1, 1987, or pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Bond Oversight and Reform Act.  The provisions of this subsection shall apply to any notes, bonds, revenue bonds, securitized bonds, loans or other appropriate form of evidence of indebtedness issued pursuant to the February 2021 Unregulated Utility Consumer Protection Act and the February 2021 Regulated Utility Consumer Protection Act.</p>

<p>B.  1.  With respect to any State Governmental Entity Financing proposed to be obtained through the issuance of its obligations, any State Governmental Entity or Local Governmental Entity shall file with the Council a written description of the nature, need and purpose of such proposed financing.  The Council shall review the description of the proposed financing in order to either approve or disapprove the purpose to be served by the issuance of the State Governmental Entity obligations and for compliance with any applicable provisions of federal, state or other laws.</p>

<p>2.  With respect to bonds or indebtedness proposed to be issued by the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority which will be enhanced or supported pursuant to the Credit Enhancement Reserve Fund Act, the Council shall review the description of such proposed financing in accordance with paragraph 1 of this subsection and additionally shall approve or disapprove the proposed financing on a determination of sufficient compliance with the Rules Regarding the Administration of the Credit Enhancement Reserve Fund as implemented by the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority.  Such determinations by the Council shall be based on a written report prepared for and provided to the Council by the Program Development and Credit Review Committee as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=103446">Section 5062.6a of Title 74</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, provided the Council shall not be bound to follow the conclusions reached by the committee in such reports.  All orders issued by the Council approving or disapproving bonds or indebtedness enhanced or supported pursuant to the Credit Enhancement Reserve Fund Act shall be final and shall not be subject to any type of appeal.</p>

<p>3.  Except as provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection, approval provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days after such approval.  Provided, if such approval expires, nothing shall prevent the State Governmental Entity from refiling with the Council for approval of such financing and, if granted, any one subsequent approval of such financing shall be valid for a period, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, as determined by the Council.</p>

<p>4.  Applicants having received approval, as provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection, may request and the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may grant, at his or her discretion, a single one-hundred-eighty-day extension.  Any request for an extension must be made at least five (5) business days prior to the expiration of the original approval.  Applicants failing to request an extension in this manner may refile with the Council as provided for in paragraph 3 of this subsection.</p>

<p>5.  In the event there is a substantial change in the nature or purpose of a proposed financing after approval by the Council, the prior approval shall be void and the State Governmental Entity shall be required to seek approval from the Council in the manner provided in paragraph 1 of this subsection.</p>

<p>C.  Local Governmental Entities, within ten (10) days following the date funds become available to the issuer from the sale of any obligation, shall file with the Council a copy of the official statement or notice of sale and any other information concerning the proposed financing required by the Council.</p>

<p>D.  Upon the request of a Local Governmental Entity, the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may provide advice and assistance to the Local Governmental Entity with respect to the issuance of obligations.  The State Treasurer may assess reasonable fees for such services.</p>
