The website shall include search capabilities.</p>

<p>D. Effective January 1, 2011, the Office of Management and Enterprise Services shall update the website with "Open Books 2.0," an expanded online database through which each individual expenditure shall be listed individually separate of aggregated amount. The information shall be searchable by term including name of recipient, entity making expenditure and date of expenditure.

No later than eighteen (18) months after "Open Books 2.0" is online, the Office of Management and Enterprise Services shall create an online archive for each fiscal year, beginning with Fiscal Year 2011, which shall be accessible and searchable to online users.</p>

<p>E. Such website shall also include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>1. For the expenditure of funds or incentive payments:</p>

<p>a. the name and principal location of the entity and/or recipients of the funds, excluding release of information relating to an individual's place of residence, release of information prohibited by subsection D of Section 24A.7 of Title 51 of the Oklahoma Statutes or by federal law relating to privacy rights,</p>

<p>J. The Oklahoma Tax Commission, the Office of the State Treasurer, all institutions of The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education and any other state agency shall provide to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services such information as is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Taxpayer Transparency Act.</p>

The Tax Commission may disallow any claim of a person for a tax credit due to its failure to file a report or return as required under the authority of this subsection.</p>

<p>L. Nothing in the Taxpayer Transparency Act shall require the disclosure of information which is required to be kept confidential by state or federal law.</p>

<p>M. The disclosure of information required by this section shall create no liability whatsoever, civil or criminal, to the State of Oklahoma or any member of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services or any employee thereof for disclosure of the information or for any error or omission in the disclosure.</p>

<p>N. The State Auditor and Inspector shall maintain a website providing public access to the documentation of stimulus funding pursuant to the requirements of this section. The website shall provide a list of all stimulus fund expenditures regardless of amount. The entire list of stimulus fund expenditures and each of the related content requirements as detailed in subsection D of this section shall be available for export in standardized formats including but not limited to eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Comma Separated Value (CSV) formats. The list of expenditures shall include searchable functionality including but not limited to the ability to search the expenditures by the name of the entity receiving funding, name of entity processing funding and name of entity benefiting from funding.</p>

<p>O. Information about tax credits subject to disclosure pursuant to this section shall include the identity of all taxpayers or organizations having any part in the chain of custody or claim to the credit or credits at any time during the credit's existence.</p>
