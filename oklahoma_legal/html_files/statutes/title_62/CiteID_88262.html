<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>For the purposes of simplifying budgetary accounting of the several counties and other municipal subdivisions of the State of Oklahoma, all public officers charged under the law with making financial statements, budgets, levies, and accounting for public funds of such municipal subdivisions of the state are hereby directed and required to account for all such public funds in the manner provided for in this act.</p>

<p>First. All funds for current requirements arising out of an ad valorem tax levy assessed and collected under the provisions of Section 9, Article 10, Constitution, as amended, except Separate School Funds, are hereby declared to constitute the "General Fund" of such county, city, town, independent or dependent school district, or other municipal subdivisions of the state. All special "funds" arising out of an ad valorem tax levy, within the limitations of said Section 9, Article 10, Constitution, except Separate School Funds, authorized or required by existing laws to be devoted to a specific or special purpose, or that may hereafter be so authorized or required, unless specifically excepted, shall, from and after the effective date of this act, be accounted for as integral "budget accounts" within and as a part of the said "General Fund." Each such integral budget account shall bear the title ascribed by law to such special purpose, and it shall be subject to be so itemized for purpose of appropriation as the law may direct for the accomplishment of such special purpose, and none of the items of appropriation within such special budget account shall ever be expended for any purpose other than provided by the law creating such special fund (now budget account) nor shall any part of it ever be available for transfer to any other budget account within the General Fund. It is provided, however, that cancellation and/or transfer between the several items of appropriation for a special purpose within the limitations and in the manner provided by law is hereby authorized.</p>

<p>The total of the items of appropriation for a special purpose for which it is not mandatory to make a levy, if now or hereafter limited to a fixed or maximum rate of ad valorem mill levy, shall be limited in amount to the equivalent of the net proceeds of such ad valorem tax rate, plus ninety percent (90%) of the miscellaneous revenue collected from such source during the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p>If a levy for a special purpose be mandatory, under legislative exercise of the sovereign powers of the state to direct a constitutional function, the total of the several items of appropriation for such mandatory special purpose must be fixed by the county excise board at the equivalent of the net proceeds of such ad valorem rate as the law may direct, plus the amount of any unexpended balance of appropriations for the same special purpose of the preceding year; provided, however, that if the said governing board of the municipality attach to the estimate of needs for the ensuing year a certificate executed under oath that all of the requirements of the legislative mandate involving such special fund or account have been fully met, the total of appropriations then to be approved shall be limited to the equivalent of the net proceeds of such mandatory levy, plus ninety percent (90%) of the miscellaneous revenue collected from such source during the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p>The total of the several items of appropriation currently necessary for salaries generally and other governmental requirements other than those authorized or required to be provided by special funds, or budget accounts as herein provided, shall constitute an integral account within the General Fund, to be known henceforth as the "Governmental Budget Account" to be itemized as now provided by law.</p>

<p>Out of such portion of the fifteen (15) mills that may be apportioned to county purposes by the county excise board, or the Legislature, under the provisions of Section 9, Article 10, Constitution, as amended, there is hereby specifically apportioned, and the equivalent of the net proceeds thereof required to be used for:</p>

<p>crippled children, mandatory to provide aid to curable defectives, one-tenth (1/10) mill;</p>

<p>County audit, mandatory to police county public funds, one-tenth (1/10) mill; and the residue of that portion of the fifteen-mill limit apportioned to county purposes shall be used, so far as may be necessary, together with other income and surpluses legally accruing to the county general fund, other than those indicated in the "Fifth" provision of this section, to provide for the estimate of needs submitted by the board of county commissioners, until otherwise provided by law, as follows:</p>

<p>Governmental Budget Account, optional with board of county commissioners; Highway Levy Budget Account, optional with board of county commissioners; Free Fair Budget Account, optional within limit of applicable statute; Free Fair Improvement Budget, optional within net proceeds of one (1) mill; Free Fair Additional Improvement Budget, optional within net proceeds of one (1) mill; Library Budget Account, optional within net proceeds of one-half (1/2) mill; Public Health Budget Account, optional within net proceeds of one (1) mill; Tick Eradication Account, optional with board of county commissioners; Bovine T. B. Budget Account, optional within limit of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00); Farm and Home Demonstration Budget Account, optional within limitations fixed by House Bill No. 649, Session Laws, 1933; and such other special budget accounts as may hereafter be provided by law.</p>

<p>Such portion of the fifteen (15) mills that may be apportioned to city and/or town purposes by the county excise board, or the Legislature, under the provisions of Section 9, Article 10, Constitution, as amended, shall be used, so far as may be necessary, together with other income and surpluses legally accruing to the general fund of such city or town, other than those indicated in the "Fifth" provision of this section, as defined herein, to provide for the estimate of needs as submitted by the governing board of such city or town, until otherwise provided by law, as follows:</p>

<p>Library Budget Account, mandatory, where applicable under provisions of House Bill No. 555, Session Laws, 1935, at not to exceed net proceeds of two (2) mills; plus ninety percent (90%) of the miscellaneous revenue collected from such source during the preceding fiscal year; Governmental Budget Accounts, optional with governing board; Cemetery Budget Account, optional within net proceeds of one-half (1/2) mill, plus ninety percent (90%) of the miscellaneous revenue collected from such source during the preceding fiscal year; Street Paving Repair Budget, optional within net proceeds of one (1) mill, plus ninety percent (90%) of the miscellaneous revenue collected from such source during the preceding fiscal year; Park Budget Account in cities having a population of more than thirty thousand (30,000) under Section 12672, Oklahoma Statutes, 1931, optional within net proceeds of one (1) mill, plus ninety percent (90%) of the miscellaneous revenue collected from such source during the preceding fiscal year; and such other special budget accounts as may hereafter be provided by law; provided, that the provisions of this act with regard to Cemetery Budget Account and restrictions as to the amount thereof shall not apply to cities, towns or municipalities which derive their revenue wholly from sources other than ad valorem taxes.</p>

<p>Such portion of the fifteen (15) mills that may be apportioned to school purposes by the county excise board, or the Legislature, together with the number of mills excess levy legally voted, under the provisions of Section 9, Article 10, Constitution, as amended, shall be used, so far as may be necessary, together with other income and surpluses accruing to the General Fund of such school district, other than those indicated in the "Fifth" provision of this Section, to provide for the estimate of needs as submitted by the governing boards of the several school districts as follows:</p>

<p>Governmental Budget Account, limited in ratio of the nontransferred pupils to the enumerated pupils as to total appropriation; Transfer Budget Account, limited in ratio of the transferred pupils to the enumerated pupils as to total appropriation; unless the Legislature should, at some future time, provide for other special budget accounts within the General Fund.</p>

<p>When the totals of all "General Fund" appropriations as integrated and defined under this subsection shall have been determined for each municipality and the levy and/or levies computed, according to law, the levy and/or levies so computed shall thenceforth cease to be separate but shall be certified, extended, collected, and distributed as a "General Fund Levy" for such municipality, accounted for, together with any other current general fund revenue, as its "General Fund," and expended by issuance of one series of General Fund Warrants for such year.</p>

<p>Second. Repealed. Laws 1953, p. 445, Section 55.</p>

<p>Third. All funds created by tax levy under the provisions of Section 10, Article 10, Constitution, are hereby declared to constitute the "Building Fund" of such municipality as may authorize such fund by legal election under the terms of said Section; and such levy shall be separately computed, certified, distributed when collected, and so expended.</p>

<p>Fourth. All funds required to be provided by ad valorem tax levy to pay outstanding indebtedness created under authority of Section 26 and/or Section 27, Article 10, Constitution, are hereby declared to constitute the "Sinking Fund" of such county or other municipal subdivision, to be used for the payment of coupons, bonds, and judgments as provided by law.</p>

<p>Fifth. All excise taxes collected by the State of Oklahoma and distributed to the counties or other municipal subdivisions under legislative enactment for specific purposes, and all contributions by the State of Oklahoma out of its General Revenues to any of the municipal subdivisions of the State to be expended under direction of statute, and all local collections required by law to be accounted for as cash funds, shall, when received by the treasurer thereof, to set up in a distinct and separate "Cash Fund", identified in the title thereof by the purpose for which such distribution or contribution is made; and all warrants drawn thereon shall be payable on demand. None of these excise taxes or state contributions shall be appropriated by the county excise board before the cash is actually on hand; then the governing board involved shall prepare an estimate of needs to be met therefrom and submit it to the county excise board, and if said excise board finds said estimate to be for legal purposes and the treasurer thereof certifies that the cash is actually on hand, then the excise board shall approve such estimate.</p>
