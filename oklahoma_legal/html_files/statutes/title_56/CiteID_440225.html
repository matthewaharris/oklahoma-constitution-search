<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT size=+0>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. In all cases being enforced by the Department of 
Human Services pursuant to the state child support plan, unless the amount of 
past due support has been determined in a court proceeding within the past 
twelve (12) months, the Department shall serve a notice upon the obligor no less 
than once every twelve (12) months informing the obligor of the 
following:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The style and case number of the support order or 
orders being enforced by the Department;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The amount of the current support obligation and 
the total amount of alleged past due support pursuant to the support order or 
orders;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. That all payments for current support and payments 
for past due support owed to the Department or to the obligee shall be paid to 
the Centralized Support Registry at the address specified in the notice, and 
thereafter, any payments made other than to the Support Registry shall not be 
credited to the amount owed;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The obligor's street address and mailing address 
as stated in the notice shall be the obligor's address or addresses of record 
for service of process on file in the central case registry provided for in 
Section 112A of Title 43 of the Oklahoma Statutes; and thereafter, the obligor 
must inform the central case registry at the address specified in the notice in 
writing within thirty (30) days of any change;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. That if the information contained in the notice is 
incorrect or incomplete concerning the name and address of the obligor's current 
employer or other payors of income, dependent health insurance information, or 
other information requested by the Department, the obligor is required to inform 
the central case registry in writing of any changes or additions to the 
information within thirty (30) days of service of the notice and thereafter to 
inform the central case registry within thirty (30) days of any 
change;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. An income assignment is in effect and that the 
amounts specified in the notice shall be withheld from the obligor's income for 
current support and past due support;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. The income assignment will be served upon all 
current and subsequent payors of income without further notice to the 
obligor;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. The income assignment will remain in effect 
regardless of whether any past due amounts are owed, for as long as the order 
upon which it is based, or for as long as past due support is owed, whichever is 
later, and payment of any amount will not prevent the income assignment from 
taking effect;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. That if there is no order for payment of the past 
due amount, when any amount of support becomes thirty (30) days past due, the 
Department is authorized to direct the obligor's payor of income to withhold an 
amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the current support obligation, and 
that this amount shall continue to be withheld until the past due support is 
paid in full, or until further order;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. That if the obligor has failed to comply with an 
order to provide health insurance, the obligor's employer will be required to 
enroll the obligor's minor children who are the subject of the referenced order 
in any dependent health insurance plan offered by the employer to the obligor, 
and to deduct the amount of the premium from the obligor's income;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. A list of all actions and remedies the Department 
may take to enforce the order and to collect past due support. The list may 
include a specific payment plan;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. That the obligor will be given this notice no 
less than once every twelve (12) months, and after initial service of the notice 
as provided in subsection C of this section, subsequent notices will be mailed 
by regular mail to the last address for the obligor on file in the central case 
registry;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>13. That the obligor may request an administrative 
review on a form attached to the notice within twenty (20) days of the date the 
notice is served upon the obligor which will be granted only on the following 
grounds:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. a mistake of identity, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the existence or the amount of current support or 
past due support is incorrect;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>14. That the obligor has been given notice and 
opportunity to contest the past due amount stated in the notice and that the 
obligor will not be entitled to another opportunity to contest that amount; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>15. That the notice will have the same effect as a 
court order and will be enforceable as a court order.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The notice shall be filed, at the option of the 
Department, with the clerk of the district court in the county of residence of 
the custodian of the child, in the county of residence of the obligor, or in the 
county of the underlying support order or in any other county in which the 
obligor has real or personal property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The initial notice provided for in this section 
shall be served by the Department upon the obligor as provided in Section 2005 
of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes, or if there is an address of record on 
file with the central case registry pursuant to Section 112A of Title 43 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes, the notice may be served by regular mail at the address of 
record. The Department shall serve the obligor subsequent notices by regular 
mail with a certificate of mailing to the last address of record for service of 
process for the obligor on file with the central case registry. The Department 
shall send the initial and subsequent notice to the custodian of the child by 
regular mail with a certificate of mailing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. An obligor may request an administrative review 
pursuant to this section by delivering a request to the Department in writing or 
on the form provided within twenty (20) days of the date the notice is served 
upon the obligor. If the notice is a subsequent notice as provided in subsection 
C of this section, the date of service shall be the date the notice is mailed to 
the obligor, and the notice shall state the date it is being mailed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. 1. Upon receipt of a timely request for an 
administrative review, the Department shall schedule a review to be held within 
thirty (30) days of receipt of the request. The obligor shall be served with 
notice of the administrative review as provided in subsection B of Section 2005 
of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The review shall be conducted by an 
employee of the Department who will attempt to resolve all disputed issues 
without the necessity of a hearing. If all issues are resolved at the review, 
the obligor shall sign an agreed administrative or district court order which 
shall be filed, at the option of the Department, with the clerk of the district 
court in the county of residence of the custodian of the child, in the county of 
residence of the obligor, in the county of the underlying support order, or in 
any other county in which the obligor has real or personal property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If all disputed issues are not resolved at the 
administrative review, the Department shall set the matter for a hearing. The 
obligor shall be served with notice of the hearing as provided in subsection B 
of Section 2005 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The district or 
administrative court shall hear the matter and shall enter an order determining 
the contested issues and affirming the other provisions of the notice. An 
administrative order shall be filed, at the option of the Department, with the 
clerk of the district court in the county of residence of the custodian of the 
child, in the county of residence of the obligor in the county of the underlying 
support order, or in any other county in which the obligor has real or personal 
property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If the obligor fails to request a timely 
administrative review, or fails to appear for a review or a hearing, the obligor 
may no longer contest the contents of the notice, and the obligor shall be 
obligated to make payments pursuant to the payment plan as stated in the notice 
to collect the past due support and those amounts shall be subject to income 
withholding. The notice shall have the same legal effect as a court order and be 
enforceable as a court order. The notice with proof of service upon the obligor 
and the custodian of the child shall be filed, at the option of the Department, 
with the clerk of the district court in the county of residence of the custodian 
of the child, in the county of residence of the obligor, in the county of the 
underlying support order, or in any other county in which the obligor has real 
or personal property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The district or administrative court may order an 
obligor to pay all costs involved in proceedings under this 
subsection.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. A final order entered pursuant to this section 
shall be served upon the obligor in accordance with subsection B of Section 2005 
of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</FONT></P>
