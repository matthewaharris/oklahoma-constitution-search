<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. After receiving a referral or application for 
services, the Division may initiate enforcement proceedings.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The Division may notify the obligor of the 
intention to initiate enforcement proceedings by a notice. If an income 
assignment is not in place for collection of support monies, the Division shall 
immediately execute or issue a withholding order to any payor of income to the 
obligor. The notice of enforcement proceedings pursuant to this subsection shall 
be served upon the obligor in the same manner prescribed for the service of 
summons in a civil action. However, if a notice has been issued pursuant to 
Section 237A of this title, the notice of enforcement proceedings pursuant to 
this subsection may be served by regular mail with a certificate of mailing. The 
notice shall inform the obligor of the following:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. the amount of support monies owed, if any,</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. an assignment for collection of support monies due 
and owing has commenced if a potential payor of income was known,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. other enforcement actions that the Division may 
take to collect support monies owed,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. the obligor may contest the allegations in the 
notice only with regard to mistakes of identity or the existence or the amount 
of support monies owed,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. the assignment shall remain as long as the order 
upon which it is based is in effect. Payment of any support monies will not 
prevent an income assignment from taking effect, and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. the obligor shall be required to keep the Division 
informed of the name and address of the current employer of the obligor and 
access to health insurance and other insurance policy information of the 
obligor.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. a. An obligor may request a hearing pursuant to 
this section by delivering written notice to the District Office on a form 
provided which states the date and location of the hearing if requested on or 
before the fifteenth day from the date of service of the notice. On receipt of 
the hearing request, the Division shall promptly enter the appearance of the 
obligor on the administrative court hearing docket. The administrative court 
shall hear and determine the matter and, unless the obligor successfully shows 
there is a mistake of identity or a mistake in the existence of current or 
delinquent child support, the administrative court shall enter a judgment, 
determine the amount of judgment payments, if any, and order the assignment of 
nonexempt earnings of the obligor pay the judgment and future monthly support 
payments.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. The administrative court may order an obligor to 
pay all costs involved in enforcement proceedings under this subsection and 
shall order interest as provided in Section 114 of Title 43 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes to be collected in the same manner as the payments upon which the 
interest accrued.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. The order shall be a final judgment for purposes 
of appeal. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. The Division shall send a notice of the income 
assignment to the payor to effectuate the assignment pursuant to subsection D of 
this section.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. If within fifteen (15) days of date of service of 
the notice, the obligor fails to request a hearing, pursuant to subsection A of 
this section, or after having requested a hearing fails to appear at the 
hearing, the administrative court shall enter an order granting judgment for 
arrearage, if any, establishing a judgment payment plan and approving the income 
assignment. The administrative order shall thereafter be subject to collection 
action and shall be filed, at the option of the Division, in the office of the 
court clerk in the county of residence of the custodian of the child, in the 
county of residence of the obligor, in the county of the underlying support 
order, or any other county in which the obligor has real or personal property. 
The administrative order shall be enforced by the district court in the same 
manner as an order of the district court. A copy of the order shall be served 
upon the obligor by the District Office in accordance with subsection B of 
Section 2005 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The Division shall send a notice of the income 
assignment to the payor pursuant to subsection D of this section to effectuate 
the assignment.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. 1. The notice of the income assignment required 
pursuant to subsections A and B of this section shall be sent by the Division to 
the payor on a form prescribed by the Secretary of the United States Department 
of Health and Human Services . The notice shall be sent by certified mail, 
return receipt requested, or served in accordance with law. The payor shall be 
required to comply with the provisions of this subsection and the provisions 
stated in the notice.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The assignment shall take effect on the next 
payment of income to the obligor after the payor receives notice thereof and the 
amount withheld shall be sent to the Division within seven (7) days of the date 
upon which the obligor is paid. The payor shall attach to each payment a 
statement reporting the date on which the support obligation of the obligor was 
withheld.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The payor shall withhold each pay period the 
amounts specified in the notice from the obligor's income and earnings. The 
amount withheld by the payor from the obligor's earnings shall not exceed the 
limits on the percentage of an obligor's earnings which may be assigned for 
support pursuant to Section 1171.2 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The income assignment is binding upon the payor 
until released or until further order of the Division or the district or 
administrative court.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The payor is liable for any amount up to the 
accumulated amount that should have been withheld if the payor fails to withhold 
in accordance with the provisions of the assignment notice.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Two or more income assignments may be levied 
concurrently. Any current support due shall be paid before the payment of any 
arrearages or support debt judgment.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. If the amount of support due under the assignments 
exceeds the maximum amount authorized to be withheld from earnings by Section 
1171.2 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the payor shall pay the amount due 
up to the statutory limit and shall send written notice to the Division or the 
person or agency designated to receive payments that the amount due exceeds the 
amount subject to withholding. If the payor fails to pay or notify as required 
herein, the payor may be liable for an amount up to the accumulated amount that 
is due and owing upon receipt of the notice.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. The payor shall notify the Division within ten 
(10) days of the date when the obligor is no longer employed by, being paid by, 
or providing services to the payor, and shall provide the Division with the 
obligor's last-known address and the name of the obligor's new employer or payor 
of income, if known.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. If the payor has no current or future income due 
to the obligor in his or her possession or control, or if the obligor is no 
longer employed by, being paid by, or providing services to the payor prior to 
the receipt of the notice required pursuant to subsection C of this section, the 
payor shall send written notice to the Division within ten (10) days of receipt 
of said notice. Failure to notify the Division within the required time limit 
may subject the payor to liability for an amount up to the accumulated amount 
that is due and owing upon receipt of the notice.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. The payor is liable for any amount up to the 
accumulated amount that should have been withheld and paid, and may also be 
fined not more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for each failure to make the 
required deductions if the payor:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. fails to withhold or pay the support in accordance 
with the provisions of the assignment notice, or</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. fails to notify the person or agency entitled to 
support and the Division as required.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. The Division or the obligor may bring an action 
against the payor to enforce the provisions of the notice and this subsection in 
the underlying district court case or by separate proceeding in district 
court.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. The payor may combine withheld amounts from 
income of two or more obligors in a single payment and separately identify that 
portion of the single payment which is attributable to each individual 
obligor.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>13. An income assignment issued pursuant to the 
provisions of this section shall have priority over any prior or subsequent 
garnishments of the same income.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>14. The payor may deduct from any income of the 
obligor a sum not exceeding Five Dollars ($5.00) per pay period but not to 
exceed Ten Dollars ($10.00) per month as reimbursement for costs incurred by the 
payor in complying with the income assignment.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>15. The income assignment shall remain effective 
regardless of any change of a payor.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>16. The income assignment issued pursuant to this 
section shall remain in effect as long as any support monies are owed. Payment 
of any support monies shall not prevent the income assignment from taking 
effect.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>17. The payor shall verify the obligor's address, 
employment, earnings, income, benefits, and dependent health insurance 
information upon the request of the Division.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>18. The payor may not discipline, suspend, discharge, 
or refuse to promote an obligor because of an income assignment executed 
pursuant to this section. Any payor who violates this section shall be liable to 
such obligor for all income, wages, and employment benefits lost by the obligor 
from the period of unlawful discipline, suspension, discharge, or refusal to 
promote to the reinstatement or promotion.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority 
of the Department to use its administrative powers conferred by law or rules to 
collect delinquent support without the necessity of a court order.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Any person obligated to pay support, who has left 
or is beyond the jurisdiction of the court, may be subjected to or prosecuted 
under any other proceedings available pursuant to the laws of this state for the 
enforcement of the duty of support and maintenance.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. The income assignment proceedings specified in 
this section shall be available to other states for the enforcement of child 
support and maintenance or to enforce out-of-state orders. Venue for such 
proceedings is, at the option of the obligee:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. In the county in this state in which the support 
order was entered;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. In the county in this state in which the obligee 
resides; or</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. In the county in this state in which the obligor 
resides or receives income.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. Any payment made pursuant to the provisions of 
this section by the payor shall be made payable to the Department or its 
designee, and shall be in such form of payment as provided by the order or the 
notice.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. The obligated party may execute a voluntary income 
assignment and acknowledgment at any time and submit it to the District 
Office.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. The Division shall distribute the monies due a 
person entitled to support who is not receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families within the time limit required by federal regulation.</FONT> </P><B><I>
