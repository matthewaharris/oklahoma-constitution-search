<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. The Authority may provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time, 
for the issuance of turnpike revenue bonds of the Authority for the purpose of 
paying all or any part of the cost of any one or more turnpike projects. The 
Authority, when it finds that it would be economical and beneficial to do so, 
may combine two or more, or any part thereof, or all of its proposed projects 
into one unit and consider the same as one project to the same extent and with 
like effect as if the same were a single project. The principal of and the 
interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided for such 
payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such 
rate or rates not exceeding the limitations pertaining to public trust 
indebtedness from time to time expressed in subsection E of Section 176 of Title 
60 of the Oklahoma Statutes, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 
forty (40) years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the 
Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the 
Authority at such price or prices and pursuant to such terms and conditions as 
may be fixed by the Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Authority 
shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be 
attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the 
denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of 
principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or 
without the state. If any officer whose signature or facsimile of whose 
signature appears on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be said officer before 
the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile shall nevertheless be 
valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the person had remained in 
office until such delivery. All bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this 
article shall have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments 
subject to the negotiable instruments law of this state. The bonds may be issued 
in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and 
provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal 
alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into 
coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The 
Authority may sell the bonds in such amounts and in such manner, either at 
public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine to be in the 
best interest of this state, but in no event at a discount in excess of that 
from time to time expressed in said subsection E of Section 176 of Title 60 of 
the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P>B. The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the 
payment of the cost of the turnpike project for which such bonds have been 
issued, and shall be disbursed in such manner and pursuant to such restrictions, 
if any, as the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance 
of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same. If the proceeds of 
the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than 
such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount 
of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided for in the resolution 
authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the 
same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment 
from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If 
the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall 
be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or shall be used 
by the Authority in implementing any other power expressly granted to the 
Authority in this article.</P>
<P>C. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority, subject to 
like restrictions, may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or 
without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been 
executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the 
replacement of any bonds which have become mutilated or were destroyed or lost. 
Bonds may be issued pursuant to the provisions of this article without obtaining 
the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of 
this state, and without any other proceedings or the occurrence of any other 
conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, or things that are 
specifically required by this article.</P>
<P>D. The Authority is hereby authorized to provide that the bonds:</P>
<P>1. Be made payable from time to time on demand or tender for purchase by the 
owner provided a credit facility supports such bonds, unless the Authority 
specifically determines that a credit facility is not required;</P>
<P>2. Be additionally supported by a credit facility;</P>
<P>3. Be made subject to redemption prior to maturity, with or without premium, 
on such notice and at such time or times and with such redemption provisions as 
may be determined by the Authority or with such variations as may be permitted 
in connection with a par formula;</P>
<P>4. Bear interest at a rate or rates that may vary as permitted pursuant to a 
par formula and for such period or periods of time, all as may be determined by 
the Authority; and</P>
<P>5. Be made the subject of a remarketing agreement whereby an attempt is made 
to remarket the bonds to new purchasers prior to their presentment for payment 
to the provider of the credit facility or to the Authority.</P>
<P>No credit facility, repayment agreement, par formula or remarketing agreement 
shall become effective without the approval of the Authority.</P>
<P>E. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following 
meanings:</P>
<P>1. "Credit facility" means an agreement entered into by the Authority with 
any bank, savings and loan association or other banking institution; an 
insurance company, reinsurance company, surety company, or other insurance 
institution; a corporation, investment banker or other investment institution; 
or any other financial institution providing for prompt payment of all or any 
part of the principal, whether at maturity, presentment for purchase, redemption 
or acceleration, redemption premium, if any, and interest on any bonds payable 
on demand or tender by the owner issued in accordance with this section, in 
consideration of the Authority's agreeing to repay the provider of such credit 
facility in accordance with the terms and provisions of such repayment 
agreement<STRIKE>,</STRIKE>; provided, that any such repayment agreement shall 
provide that the obligation of the Authority thereunder shall have only such 
sources of payment as are permitted for the payment of the bonds issued under 
this article; and</P>
<P>2. "Par formula" means any provision or formula adopted by the Authority to 
provide for the adjustment, from time to time, of the interest rate or rates 
borne by any such bonds so that the purchase price of such bonds in the open 
market would be as close to par as possible.</P>
<P>F. Nothing in any law heretofore enacted or enacted at the present session of 
the Legislature shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right of the Authority 
to issue bonds or other obligations the interest income, in whole or in part, on 
which is subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation.</P>
<P>G. The Authority may enter into transactions utilizing derivative products, 
and other financial products intended to hedge interest rate risk, including any 
option to enter into or terminate any of them, that the Authority deems to be 
necessary or desirable in connection with any bonds issued prior to, at the same 
time as, or after entering into such arrangement and containing terms and 
provisions, and may be with such parties, as determined by the Authority. 
Provided, any action taken by the Authority pursuant to this subsection must 
first be approved by the Oklahoma State Bond Advisor and the Council of Bond 
Oversight pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Bond Oversight and Reform 
Act.</P>
