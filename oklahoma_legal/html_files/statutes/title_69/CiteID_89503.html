<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Except in instances where there are nonresident 
owners, unknown heirs, imperfect titles, and owners whose whereabouts cannot be 
ascertained with reasonable diligence, the Authority shall give the owner an 
opportunity to sell the necessary land or interests therein to the Authority 
before resort to condemnation may be had.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The Authority may condemn such lands or interests 
therein in the following manner:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) The district judge of the county in which the 
real property may be situated, upon petition of either party, and after ten (10) 
days' notice to the opposite party, either by personal service or by leaving a 
copy thereof at his usual place of residence with some member of his family over 
fifteen (15) years of age, or, in the case of nonresidents, unknown heirs, or 
other persons whose whereabouts cannot be ascertained, by publication in two 
issues of a weekly newspaper in general circulation in the county (the ten-day 
period to begin with the first publication), shall direct the sheriff of the 
county to summons three disinterested freeholders, to be selected by the judge 
as commissioners, and who shall not be interested in a like question. The 
commissioners shall be sworn to perform their duties impartially and justly; and 
they shall inspect the real property and consider the just compensation to which 
the owner is entitled, and they shall forthwith make report in writing to the 
clerk of the court, setting forth the quantity, boundaries and just compensation 
for the property taken, and amount of injury done to the property, either 
directly or indirectly, which they assess to the owner; which report must be 
filed and recorded by the clerk, and a certified copy thereof may be transmitted 
to the county clerk of the county where the land lies, to be by him filed and 
recorded (without further acknowledgment of proof) in the same manner and with 
like force and effect as is provided for the recording of deeds. Procedure for 
service by publication as authorized herein shall be the same as provided by law 
for service by publication in civil actions, except summons need not be issued 
and served, and except as otherwise provided herein. Within ten (10) days after 
the report of commissioners is filed, the court clerk shall forward to the 
attorney of record for the condemnor, the attorney of record for each condemnee, 
and to all unrepresented condemnees a copy of the commissioners' report and a 
notice stating the time limits for filing an exception or demand for jury trial. 
This notice shall be on a form prepared by the court administrator, which shall 
be approved by the Supreme Court, and shall be distributed to all clerks of the 
district court by said court administrator. If a party has been served by 
publication, the clerk shall forward a copy of the report of commissioners and 
notice of time limits for filing an exception or demand for jury trial to the 
last-known mailing address, if any, and shall cause a copy of the notice of time 
limits to be published in one issue of a newspaper qualified to publish legal 
notices, as defined in Section 106 of Title 25 of the Oklahoma Statutes. After 
issuing the notices provided herein, the court clerk shall endorse on the notice 
form filed in the case the date and that a copy of the report together with the 
notice was mailed to each party or his attorney of record, or the date the 
notice was published in compliance with the provisions hereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) Immediately upon payment to the clerk of the 
court for the use of the owner the sum so assessed and reported to him as 
aforesaid, the Authority shall thereby be authorized to enter upon the condemned 
premises, and remove and dispose of any obstructions thereon, by sale or 
otherwise. If the landowner shall refuse to deliver up possession to the 
Authority, the court shall issue an order to the sheriff of the county to place 
the Authority in possession thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) The report of commissioners may be reviewed by 
the district court, on written exceptions filed by either party in the clerk's 
office within thirty (30) days after the filing of such report, and the court, 
after hearing had, shall make such order therein as right and justice may 
require, either by confirmation, rejection or by ordering a new appraisement on 
good cause shown. Provided, that in the event a new appraisement is ordered, the 
Authority shall have the continuing right of possession obtained under the first 
appraisal, unless and until its right to condemn has finally been determined 
otherwise; or either party may within sixty (60) days after the filing of such 
report file with the clerk a written demand for a trial by jury, in which case 
the amount of damages shall be assessed by a jury, and the trial shall be 
conducted and judgment entered in the same manner as civil actions in the 
district court. No owner upon whom proper service by publication has been had as 
provided in this article shall be let in to defend after expiration of time for 
appeal or review of the report of commissioners, as above provided, has elapsed. 
Provided, that if, after the filing of exceptions to the report of commissioners 
as herein provided, the Authority shall fail to establish its right to condemn 
the premises, or any part thereof, the landowner shall be restored to possession 
of the premises, or part thereof, and the Authority shall pay him for any 
damages sustained through the occupation by the Authority, and if the damages 
cannot be determined by amicable settlement they shall be determined by jury 
trial in the same proceedings. The time limits for filing an exception and 
demand for jury trial shall be calculated from the date the report of 
commissioners is filed in the case. On failure of the court clerk to give notice 
within the time prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the court, on 
application of any party, may extend the time for filing an exception to the 
report, or a demand for trial by jury for a period not to exceed twenty (20) 
days from the date the application is heard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) Either party aggrieved may appeal to the Supreme 
Court from the decision of the district court on exception to the report of 
commissioners, or jury trial; but such review or appeal shall not delay the 
prosecution of the work on such turnpike project over the premises in question 
if the award of commissioners, or jury, as the case may be, has been deposited 
with the clerk for the owner. The Authority shall in all cases pay the cost and 
expenses of the first assessment. And in case of review or appeal, a certified 
copy of the final order or judgment shall be transmitted by the clerk of the 
court, duly certified, to the proper county clerk, to be by him filed and 
recorded as hereinabove provided for the recording of the report, and with like 
effect.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Where an estate is being probated, or a minor or 
incompetent person has a legal guardian, the administrator or executor of such 
estate, or the guardian of such minor or incompetent person, shall have 
authority to execute all instruments of conveyance provided for in this article 
on behalf of the estate, minor or incompetent person without other proceedings 
than approval by the judge of the district court endorsed on the instrument of 
conveyance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) "Just compensation", as used in this section, 
shall mean the value of the property taken, and in addition, any injury to any 
part of the property not taken. Any special and direct benefits to the part of 
the property not taken may be offset only against any injury to the property not 
taken. If only a part of a tract is taken, just compensation shall be 
ascertained by determining the difference between the fair market value of the 
whole tract immediately before the taking and the fair market value of that 
portion left remaining immediately after the taking.</FONT></P><B><I>
