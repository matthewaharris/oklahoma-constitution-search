advertisement shall provide for bids on sections of the turnpike not to exceed 
eight (8) miles. If the project advertised is a surface-treatment-only project 
of more than twenty (20) miles of road, the advertisement shall provide for bids 
on sections of the road no longer than twenty (20) miles, as well as bids on the 
project as a whole. Subject to the following restrictions and limitations, the 
Authority shall, when contracting for construction work, divide such work into 
paving projects, bridge projects, including underpasses and overpasses, and 
earthmoving or miscellaneous projects, according to the type of work to be done. 
Each project shall be let under a separate contract or contracts and no contract 
or project shall include more than one of such types of construction work. Each 
contract for construction work shall contain a provision that ninety percent 
(90%) of all labor employed on the project shall be residents of Oklahoma. 
However, contracts for bridges may include earthwork and structures for the 
approaches thereto.</P>
<P>(o) It shall be unlawful for any member, officer or employee of the Authority 
to transact with the Authority, either directly or indirectly, any business for 
profit of such member, officer, or employee; and any person, firm, or 
corporation knowingly participating therein shall be equally liable for 
violation of this provision.</P>
<P>The term "business for profit" shall include, but not be limited to, the 
acceptance or payment of any fee, commission, gift, or consideration to such 
member, officer, or employee.</P>
<P>Violation of this provision shall constitute a felony punishable by 
incarceration in the State Penitentiary for a term not to exceed five (5) years 
or a fine of not less than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and not more than Five 
Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), or both such imprisonment and fine.</P>
<P>(p) In the event of a national emergency, the Authority, subject to any 
vested rights or claims, may enter into contracts with the federal government or 
any authorized agency thereof to allow the federal government or agency thereof 
to use such turnpikes partly or exclusively during the existence of such 
emergency, provided, that the federal government agrees in such contract to pay, 
during the term of such contract, an amount sufficient, when added to any tolls 
collected, to meet all operating and maintenance expenses, interest payments, 
and the minimum sinking fund and reserve requirements of the trust agreement for 
the turnpike covered by the contract.</P>
<P>(q) All meetings of the Authority shall be open public meetings, and all 
records shall be public records, except when considering personnel or 
litigation.</P>
