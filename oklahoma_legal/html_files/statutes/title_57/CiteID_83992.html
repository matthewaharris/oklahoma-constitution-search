<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>
<P>A. The Department of Corrections is hereby authorized to provide for 
incarceration, supervision, and residential treatment at facilities other than 
those operated by the Department of Corrections. Services offered for persons 
under the custody or supervision of the Department are to include, but not be 
limited to, housing, alcoholism or drug treatment, mental health services, 
nursing home care, or halfway house placement. Such services must meet standards 
prescribed and established by the State Board of Corrections for implementing 
such a program, including but not limited to standards concerning internal and 
perimeter security, discipline of inmates, educational and vocational training 
programs, employment of inmates, and proper food, clothing, housing, and medical 
care. Such services must be contracted for in accordance with Section 85.7 of 
Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Such services, if provided by private prison 
contractors, shall be contracted for as required by this section.</P>
<P>B. The Department of Corrections is authorized to lease existing facilities 
or portions thereof from private prison contractors, counties or other 
governmental entities and operate such facilities or portions thereof in the 
same manner as other state owned and operated prison facilities. All lease 
agreements entered into pursuant to this section shall be negotiated between the 
Department and the lessor. The Office of Management and Enterprise Services 
shall assist in the negotiations if requested by the Department of 
Corrections.</P>
<P>C. Subject to the requirements of this section and Section 561.1 of this 
title, the Department of Corrections is hereby authorized to provide for the 
construction or operation or both construction and operation of correctional 
institutions of the Department of Corrections by private prison contractors. 
Such operation shall meet standards prescribed by the State Board of 
Corrections, including but not limited to, standards concerning internal and 
perimeter security, discipline of inmates, educational and vocational training 
programs, and proper food, clothing, housing, transportation, and medical care. 
Such services shall be contracted for in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 561.1 of this title and the provisions of this section.</P>
<P>D. A comprehensive file for all private prison contractors interested in and 
capable of operating an institution within the Department of Corrections or 
providing for the housing, care, and control of inmates in a facility owned and 
operated by the contractor shall be maintained by the Department. These files 
shall include:</P>
<P>1. A completed application form;</P>
<P>2. A resume of the contractor's staff and capability;</P>
<P>3. A completed performance evaluation form for past projects on which the 
contractor has provided private prison services;</P>
<P>4. A list of past contracts with this state;</P>
<P>5. A list of contracts to provide similar services to other states or to the 
United States; and</P>
<P>6. The mailing address of each private prison contractor.</P>
<P>Any person or firm wishing to be a private prison contractor may request at 
any time to be included in the comprehensive file, and shall be provided 
necessary forms within twenty (20) days of the request and the Department shall 
add such contractor to the list within twenty (20) days of receipt of a properly 
completed application.</P>
<P>The Department may solicit evaluation of work done by private prison 
contractors from members of the private sector, which evaluation shall be part 
of the comprehensive file.</P>
<P>E. If the Department intends to secure the services of a private prison 
contractor, all persons and firms included in the file shall be notified through 
the mail of such intent. Such notification shall contain the following 
information:</P>
<P>1. Description and scope of the project or projects;</P>
<P>2. Estimated time schedule for project;</P>
<P>3. Last date for submitting notice of interest in performing services to the 
Director; and</P>
<P>4. Other pertinent data.</P>
<P>Private prison contractors desiring consideration shall meet the requirements 
of this section and to be considered shall submit a letter expressing interest 
in the project to the Department within thirty (30) days of the postmark date of 
the letter of notification mailed by the Department. Contractors shall file an 
updated application form at the request of the Department.</P>
<P>F. The Department shall define the scope of a proposed project, determine the 
various project components, phases and timetables, and prepare detailed project 
descriptions to guide prospective contractors. Before the Department awards a 
contract to a private prison contractor, the plans shall be approved by the 
State Board of Corrections.</P>
<P>G. The Department shall review the files of the private prison contractors 
desiring consideration for the project. After performing the analysis required 
by Section 561.1 of this title, the Department shall select no less than three 
and no more than five contractors for more detailed consideration. In the event 
interviews for more than one contract are being considered at the same time, the 
number of contractors selected for more detailed consideration should be at 
least twice the number of contracts contemplated. This initial screening should 
consider the requirements of the project, as well as the following factors to be 
determined from the comprehensive file, and replies to inquiries to former 
clients:</P>
<P>1. Specialized experience in the type of work contemplated;</P>
<P>2. Capacity of the contractor to accomplish the work in the required time; 
and</P>
<P>3. Past performance, from the performance evaluation form.</P>
<P>H. A full report of the evaluation procedures and recommendations of the 
Department shall be prepared by the Department and submitted to the State Board 
of Corrections for the independent review of the entire process.</P>
<P>I. 1. The Department shall select the contractor whose qualifications and 
project proposal most substantially meet the criteria of the project 
description.</P>
<P>2. The Department shall execute the contract with the selected contractor, 
which contract shall include a fair and reasonable fee.</P>
<P>3. The negotiated scope and fee shall be reported to the Board for the 
approval of the award of the contract.</P>
<P>J. The Office of Management and Enterprise Services shall render assistance 
to the Department of Corrections in implementing the contracting procedures 
provided for in this section. The Office of Management and Enterprise Services 
may have a representative at any meeting involving negotiations of a contract 
between the Department and a private prison contractor. Before submission of the 
proposed contract to the Council on Bond Oversight, and prior to the date as of 
which the proposed contract is executed by the State Board of Corrections, the 
Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise 
Services shall review the proposed final version of the contract. The Attorney 
General and the Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services 
shall have a period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of the proposed final 
version of the contract to approve the contract and execute the document. If 
either the Attorney General or the Director of the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services has objections to the proposed contract, the objections 
shall be communicated in writing to the Department of Corrections. The 
Department of Corrections shall take appropriate action regarding the objections 
and shall resubmit the proposed contract for additional review. The Attorney 
General and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services shall have an 
additional fifteen-day period to approve the proposed contract and to execute 
the document. Failure of the Attorney General or the Director of the Office of 
Management and Enterprise Services, respectively, to act within the fifteen-day 
period shall constitute approval of the respective official to the proposed 
final version of the contract. The contract shall contain a separate signature 
block or line for signature by the Attorney General and the Office of Management 
and Enterprise Services. The contract shall contain a statement to be executed 
by the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services that each one of them, respectively, has reviewed the 
proposed contract for compliance with the provisions of this section and Section 
561.1 of this title, and all other applicable provisions of law and that the 
contract conforms with those requirements. Neither the private prison contractor 
nor the State Board of Corrections shall execute the contract until the document 
has been executed by the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of 
Management and Enterprise Services as required by this subsection unless the 
approval of the respective official has been made as a result of failure to take 
action within the fifteen-day period prescribed by this subsection.</P>
<P>K. The Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services is 
authorized to lease real property and improvements thereon to a private prison 
contractor in conjunction with a contract for private management of a state 
correctional institution located or to be built on the property. Said lease may 
be entered into for one (1) year periods, renewable at the sole option of the 
State of Oklahoma, but not to exceed a cumulative period of fifty (50) 
years.</P>
<P>L. Contracts awarded to private prison contractors pursuant to the provisions 
of this section shall be entered into for a period specified in each contract, 
subject to availability of funds annually appropriated by the Legislature for 
that purpose. No contract awarded pursuant to this section shall provide for the 
encumbrance of funds beyond the amount available for a fiscal year.</P>
<P>M. No contract authorized by the provisions of this section shall be awarded 
until the private prison contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
State Board of Corrections:</P>
<P>1. That the contractor possesses the necessary qualifications and experience 
to provide the services specified in the contract;</P>
<P>2. That the contractor can provide the necessary qualified personnel to 
implement the terms of the contract;</P>
<P>3. That the financial condition of the contractor is such that the terms of 
the contract can be fulfilled;</P>
<P>4. That the contractor has the ability to comply with applicable court orders 
and corrections standards; and</P>
<P>5. That, in the case of a contractor who will be providing the services in a 
nondepartmental facility operated by said contractor, the contractor shall be 
able to meet accreditation standards and receive accreditation, as required by 
the terms of the contract pursuant to subsection C of Section 561.1 of this 
title.</P>
<P>N. No contract authorized by the provisions of this section shall be awarded 
until the private prison contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Board that the contractor can obtain insurance or provide self-insurance to:</P>
<P>1. Indemnify the state against possible lawsuits arising from the operation 
of prison facilities by the contractor; and</P>
<P>2. Compensate the state for any property damage or expenses incurred due to 
the operation of prison facilities.</P>
<P>O. A private prison contractor shall not be bound by state laws or other 
legislative enactments governing the appointment, qualifications, duties, 
salaries, or benefits of wardens, superintendents, or other correctional 
employees, except that any personnel authorized to carry and use firearms shall 
comply with the certification standards required by the provisions of Section 
3311 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and be authorized to use firearms only 
to prevent a felony, to prevent escape from custody, or to prevent an act which 
would cause death or serious bodily injury to the personnel or to another 
person.</P>
<P>P. Any offense which would be a crime if committed within a state 
correctional institution also shall be a crime if committed in an institution or 
facility operated by a private prison contractor.</P>
<P>Q. The Director or his designee shall monitor the performance of the 
contractor.</P>
