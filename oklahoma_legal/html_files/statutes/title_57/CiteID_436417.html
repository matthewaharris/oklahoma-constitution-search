<p><em><strong>Multiple Amendments Enacted During the 2024 and 2025 Legislative Session</strong></em></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Version 1 (Amended by Laws 2024, HB 3936, c. 59, § 38, eff. November 1, 2024)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;A. Except as otherwise provided by law, every inmate of a state correctional institution shall have their term of imprisonment reduced monthly, based upon the class level to which they are assigned. Earned credits may be subtracted from the total credits accumulated by an inmate, upon recommendation of the institution's disciplinary committee, following due process, and upon approval of the warden or superintendent. Each earned credit is equivalent to one (1) day of incarceration. Lost credits may be restored by the warden or superintendent upon approval of the classification committee. If a maximum and minimum term of imprisonment is imposed, the provisions of this subsection shall apply only to the maximum term. No deductions shall be credited to any inmate serving a sentence of life imprisonment; however, a complete record of the inmate's participation in work, school, vocational training, or other approved program shall be maintained by the Department for consideration by the paroling authority. No earned credit deductions shall be credited or recorded for any inmate serving any sentence for a criminal act which resulted in the death of a police officer, a law enforcement officer, an employee of the Department of Corrections, or an employee of a private prison contractor and the death occurred while the police officer, law enforcement officer, employee of the Department of Corrections, or employee of a private prison contractor was acting within the scope of their employment. No earned credit deductions shall be credited or recorded for any person who is referred to an intermediate revocation facility for violating any of the terms and conditions of probation.</p>

<p>B. The Department of Corrections is directed to develop a written policy and procedure whereby inmates shall be assigned to one of four class levels determined by an adjustment review committee of the facility to which the inmate is assigned. The policies and procedures developed by the Department shall include, but not be limited to, written guidelines pertaining to awarding credits for rehabilitation, obtaining job skills and educational enhancement, participation in and completion of alcohol/chemical abuse programs, incentives for inmates to accept work assignments and jobs, work attendance and productivity, conduct record, participation in programs, cooperative general behavior, and appearance. When assigning inmates to a class level the adjustment review committee shall consider all aspects of the policy and procedure developed by the Department, including but not limited to, the criteria for awarding credits required by this subsection.</p>

<p>C. If an inmate is subject to misconduct, nonperformance or disciplinary action, earned credits may be removed according to the policies and procedures developed by the Department. Earned credits removed for misconduct, nonperformance or disciplinary action may be restored as provided by Department policy, if any.</p>

<p>D. 1. Class levels shall be as follows:</p>

<p>a. Class level 1 shall include inmates not eligible to participate in class levels 2 through 4, and shall include, but not be limited to, inmates on escape status.</p>

<p>b. Class level 2 shall include an inmate who has been given a work, education, or program assignment, has received a good evaluation for participation in the work, education, or program assignment, and has received a good evaluation for personal hygiene and maintenance of living area.</p>

<p>c. Class level 3 shall include an inmate who has been incarcerated at least three (3) months, has received an excellent work, education, or program evaluation, and has received an excellent evaluation for personal hygiene and maintenance of living area.</p>

<p>d. Class level 4 shall include an inmate who has been incarcerated at least eight (8) months, has received an outstanding work, education, or program evaluation, and has received an outstanding evaluation for personal hygiene and maintenance of living area.</p>

<p>2. a. Until November 1, 2001, class level corresponding credits are as follows:</p>

<p>Class 1 - 0 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 2 - 22 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 3 - 33 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 4 - 44 Credits per month.</p>

<p>b. Class level corresponding credits beginning November 1, 2001, for inmates who have ever been convicted as an adult or a youthful offender or adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile for a felony offense enumerated in subsection E of this section are as follows:</p>

<p>Class 1 - 0 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 2 - 22 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 3 - 33 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 4 - 44 Credits per month.</p>

<p>c. Class level corresponding credits beginning November 1, 2001, for inmates who have never been convicted as an adult or a youthful offender or adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile for a felony offense enumerated in subsection E of this section are as follows:</p>

<p>Class 1  0 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 2  22 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 3  45 Credits per month;</p>

<p>Class 4  60 Credits per month.</p>

<p>Each inmate shall receive the above specified monthly credits for the class to which he or she is assigned. In determining the prior criminal history of the inmate, the Department of Corrections shall review criminal history records available through the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and National Crime Information Center to determine the reported felony convictions of all inmates. The Department of Corrections shall also review the Office of Juvenile Affairs Juvenile On-line Tracking System for inmates who were adjudicated delinquent or convicted as a youthful offender for a crime that would be an offense enumerated in subsection E of this section.</p>

<p>3. In addition to the criteria established for each class in paragraph 1 of this subsection, the following requirements shall apply to each of levels 2 through 4:</p>

<p>a. satisfactory participation in the work, education, or program assignment at the standard required for the particular class level,</p>

<p>b. maintenance of a clean and orderly living area and personal hygiene at the standard required for the particular class level,</p>

<p>c. cooperative behavior toward facility staff and other inmates, and</p>

<p>d. satisfactory participation in the requirements of the previous class level.</p>

<p>4. The evaluation scale for assessing performance shall be as follows:</p>

<p>a. Outstanding - For inmates who display consistently exceptional initiative, motivation, and work habits.</p>

<p>b. Excellent - For inmates who display above-average work habits with only minor errors and rarely perform below expectations.</p>

<p>c. Good - For inmates who perform in a satisfactory manner and complete tasks as required, doing what is expected, with only occasional performance above or below expectations.</p>

<p>d. Fair - For inmates who may perform satisfactorily for some periods of time, but whose performance is marked by obviously deficient and weak areas and could be improved.</p>

<p>e. Poor - For inmates whose performance is unsatisfactory and falls below expected and acceptable standards.</p>

<p>E. No person ever convicted as an adult or a youthful offender or adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile in this state for any felony offense enumerated in this subsection or a similar felony offense pursuant to the provisions of another state, the United States, or a military court shall be eligible for the credits provided by the provisions of subparagraph c of paragraph 2 of subsection D of this section.</p>
