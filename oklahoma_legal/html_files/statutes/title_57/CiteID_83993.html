<P>A. Except as otherwise provided by subsection K of this section, prior to 
entering into a contract with any private prison contractor for construction or 
operation, or both, of a correctional facility, the Department of Corrections 
shall establish a process for requesting proposals or negotiated contracts from 
such contractors. The Department of Corrections shall develop criteria for the 
process by which a contractor for the construction or operation, or both, of a 
private prison is to be awarded a contract. The criteria shall be subject to 
approval by the State Board of Corrections. The criteria for selection of a site 
for a proposed facility to be constructed or operated, or both, by a private 
contractor shall include, but shall not be limited to, the availability of 
medical services, support services, transportation services and the availability 
of potential employees who would be qualified to perform required functions at a 
state correctional facility.</P>
<P>B. Any contract between the Department of Corrections and a private prison 
contractor, whereby the contractor provides for the housing, care, and control 
of inmates in a nondepartmental facility operated by the contractor, shall 
contain, in addition to other provisions, terms and conditions:</P>
<P>1. Requiring the contractor to provide said services in a facility which 
meets accreditation standards established by the American Correctional 
Association;</P>
<P>2. Requiring the contractor to receive accreditation for said facility from 
the American Correctional Association, within three (3) years of commencement of 
operations of the facility;</P>
<P>3. Requiring the contractor to obtain written authorization from the 
governing board of any municipality in which the facility is to be located, or 
if the facility is not to be located within a municipality, written 
authorization from the board of county commissioners of the county in which the 
facility is to be located; and</P>
<P>4. Granting the Department the option at the beginning of each fiscal year 
pursuant to an agreement, to purchase any such facility, with or without 
inventory or other personal property, at a predetermined price, which shall be 
negotiated and included in a schedule or a formula to be contained in the 
original agreement. Such agreements relating to a correctional facility, the 
construction of which was financed or is to be financed by obligations issued 
from a local governmental entity the repayment of which is to be made in whole 
or in part from rentals from the State of Oklahoma or the Department of 
Corrections, shall be submitted to the Council on Bond Oversight as provided in 
subsection I of this section.</P>
<P>C. A contractor proposing to enter a contract with the Department of 
Corrections for construction or operation, or both, of a correctional facility 
pursuant to this section must demonstrate:</P>
<P>1. The qualifications and the operations and management experience to carry 
out the terms of the contract; and</P>
<P>2. The ability to comply with the standards of the American Correctional 
Association and with specific court orders.</P>
<P>D. In addition to meeting the requirements specified in the requests for 
proposals, a proposal for the construction and operation of a correctional 
facility must:</P>
<P>1. Provide for regular, on-site monitoring by the Department of 
Corrections;</P>
<P>2. Acknowledge that payment by the state is subject to the availability of 
appropriations;</P>
<P>3. Provide for payment of a maximum amount per fiscal year;</P>
<P>4. Demonstrate a cost benefit to the State of Oklahoma when compared to the 
level and quality of programs provided by state-operated facilities that have 
similar types of inmates at an operational cost not more than the cost of 
housing inmates in similar facilities and providing similar programs to those 
types of inmates in state-operated facilities. The Department of Corrections 
shall be responsible for determining the cost/benefit of the proposal;</P>
<P>5. Permit the state to terminate the contract for cause;</P>
<P>6. Contain a proposed per diem operational cost per inmate for the initial 
year and subsequent years of operations;</P>
<P>7. Subject to appropriations, provide that cost adjustments may be made only 
once each fiscal year, to take effect at the beginning of the next fiscal year 
using as the maximum percentage increase, if any, an increase not to exceed the 
previous year's Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as prepared 
by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, except as otherwise provided by 
subsection K of this section;</P>
<P>8. Have an initial contract term of not more than one (1) year, with an 
option to renew for additional periods not to exceed twenty (20) years;</P>
<P>9. If the proposal includes construction of a facility, contain a performance 
bond approved by the Department that is adequate and appropriate for the 
proposed contract;</P>
<P>10. Provide for assumption of liability by the private vendor for all claims 
arising from the services performed under the contract by the private 
vendor;</P>
<P>11. Provide for an adequate plan of insurance for the private vendor and its 
officers, employees, and agents against all claims, including claims based on 
violations of civil rights arising from the services performed under the 
contract by the private vendor;</P>
<P>12. Provide for an adequate plan of insurance to protect the state against 
all claims arising from the services performed under the contract by the private 
vendor and to protect the state from actions by a third party against the 
private vendor, its officers, employees, and agents as a result of the 
contract;</P>
<P>13. Provide plans for the purchase and assumption of operations by the state 
in the event of the bankruptcy of the private vendor; and</P>
<P>14. Contain comprehensive standards for conditions of confinement.</P>
<P>E. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Department of Corrections shall 
determine the budgeted average daily cost per inmate. The budgeted average daily 
cost per inmate shall include all direct and indirect costs incurred by the 
Department. There shall be a separate computation of budgeted average daily cost 
for maximum security, medium security, minimum security, and community 
facilities. This information shall be presented to the State Board of 
Corrections for informational purposes only. After the close of each fiscal 
year, the Department shall determine the actual average daily cost per inmate 
for the operational costs at each major category of correctional facility. The 
actual average daily cost per inmate shall include all direct and indirect costs 
incurred by the Department. There shall be a separate computation of the average 
daily rate for maximum security, medium security, minimum security, and 
community facilities. The Department shall present to the State Board of 
Corrections at its January meeting comparative data on budgeted daily cost 
versus actual daily cost, and, after appropriate review and analysis, the Board 
shall adopt as a final action of the Board an average daily cost per inmate by 
facility category for the immediately preceding fiscal year.</P>
<P>F. If a request for proposal process is utilized and no proposals conform to 
the established criteria, the Department shall prepare an additional request for 
proposals. The Department of Corrections shall evaluate the proposals within 
thirty (30) days of receipt from the prospective contractor. The Department of 
Corrections shall specifically determine whether a proposal meets the 
requirements of paragraph 4 of subsection D of this section by comparing the 
daily rate for housing and care of inmates pursuant to any proposed contract 
with a private contractor to the daily rate for housing and care of inmates at 
the comparable type of facility operated by the Department of Corrections using 
the information provided pursuant to paragraph 6 of subsection D of this 
section. The Department shall evaluate proposals taking into account any direct 
or indirect costs that would continue to be paid by the Department of 
Corrections including, but not limited to, transportation, records management, 
discipline, general administration, management of inmate trust funds, and major 
medical coverage. Such costs shall be added to the proposed per diem of the 
private vendor when comparing the total per diem costs of the state operating 
facilities.</P>
<P>G. If the Department of Corrections proposes to enter into a contract for the 
construction or the operation, or both, of a private prison, the Department 
shall compare both the capital costs and the operating costs for the facility to 
the imputed capital costs and the projected operating costs of a comparable 
facility constructed and operated by the Department of Corrections.</P>
<P>H. The Department of Corrections shall deliver to the State Board of 
Corrections the top three qualified prospective private prison contractors 
identified pursuant to this section and pursuant to Section 561 of this title 
together with the information reviewed and analyzed by the Department of 
Corrections during analysis of the proposals as required by this section. The 
Board of Corrections shall evaluate the information provided and shall make a 
final decision selecting the contractor within fifteen (15) days of receipt of 
the information.</P>
<P>I. Any contract subject to the provisions of this section entered into by the 
Board of Corrections shall be subject to the approval of the Council on Bond 
Oversight in the same manner as provided by law for the review of issuance of 
obligations by State Governmental Entities as prescribed by Section 695.8 of 
Title 62 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P>J. Before submission of the proposed contract to the Council on Bond 
Oversight, and prior to the date as of which the proposed contract is executed 
by the Board of Corrections, the Attorney General and the Director of the Office 
of Management and Enterprise Services shall review the proposed final version of 
the contract. The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management 
and Enterprise Services shall have a period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of 
the proposed final version of the contract to approve the contract and execute 
the document. If either the Attorney General or the Director of the Office of 
Management and Enterprise Services has objections to the proposed contract, the 
objections shall be communicated in writing to the Department of Corrections. 
The Department of Corrections shall take appropriate action regarding the 
objections and shall resubmit the proposed contract for additional review. The 
Attorney General and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services shall have 
an additional fifteen-day period to approve the proposed contract and to execute 
the document. Failure of the Attorney General or the Director of the Office of 
Management and Enterprise Services, respectively, to act within the fifteen-day 
period shall constitute approval of the respective official to the proposed 
final version of the contract. The contract shall contain a separate signature 
block or line for signature by the Attorney General and the Office of Management 
and Enterprise Services. The contract shall contain a statement to be executed 
by the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services that each one of them, respectively, has reviewed the 
proposed contract for compliance with the provisions of this section and <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=83992">Section 561</A> of this title, and all 
other applicable provisions of law and that the contract conforms with those 
requirements. Neither the private prison contractor nor the State Board of 
Corrections shall execute the contract until the document has been executed by 
the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise 
Services as required by this subsection unless the approval of the respective 
official has been made as a result of failure to take action within the 
fifteen-day period prescribed by this subsection.</P>
<P>K. The State Board of Corrections may renew a private prison contract which 
is in effect for any time period during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, if 
the Board determines that the renewal of such contract will result in a reduced 
per diem in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. If the State Board of 
Corrections makes such determination, the contract shall not be subject to the 
restrictions of paragraph 7 of subsection D of this section and the Board shall 
negotiate the contract based upon such terms as the Board deems to be in the 
best interest of operational efficiency, including the inmate population, per 
inmate cost, public safety and such other terms as the State Board of 
Corrections determines to be relevant to such contract. The State Board of 
Corrections shall have the authority to negotiate the term of any contract 
executed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection subject to the 
availability of appropriations to the Department of Corrections each year.</P>
