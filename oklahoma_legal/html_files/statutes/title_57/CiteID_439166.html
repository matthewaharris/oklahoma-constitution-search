<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. &nbsp;The Director of the Department of Corrections shall have the following specific powers and duties relating to the penal institutions:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;To appoint, subject to the approval of the State Board of Corrections, a warden for each penal institution;</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;To fix the duties of the wardens and to appoint and fix the duties and compensation of such other personnel for each penal institution as may be necessary for the proper operation thereof. &nbsp;However, correctional officers hired after November 1, 1995, shall be subject to the following qualifications:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;the minimum age for service shall be twenty (20) years of age. &nbsp;The Director shall have the authority to establish the maximum age for correctional officers entering service,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;possession of a minimum of thirty (30) semester hours from an accredited college or university, or possession of a high school diploma acquired from an accredited high school or GED equivalent testing program,</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;satisfactory completion of minimum testing or professional evaluation through the Merit System of Personnel Administration to determine the fitness of the individual to serve in the position. &nbsp;All written evaluations shall be submitted to the Department of Corrections, and</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;satisfactory completion of a physical in keeping with the conditions of the job description on an annual basis and along the guidelines as established by the Department of Corrections;</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;The Director shall designate as correctional peace officers, correctional officers who are employed in job classifications of correctional security officer, correctional security manager, correctional chief of security and chief of security upon satisfactory completion of a basic course of instruction for correctional officers, as provided for in paragraph 4 of this subsection. &nbsp;The peace officer authority of employees designated as correctional peace officers shall be limited to: &nbsp;maintaining custody of prisoners; preventing attempted escapes; pursuing, recapturing and incarcerating escapees and parole or probation violators and arresting such escapees, parole or probation violators; serving warrants; carrying firearms; preventing contraband from entering any penal institution; arresting individuals who commit crimes at any penal institution; and performing any duties specifically required for the job descriptions. &nbsp;Such powers and duties of correctional peace officers may be exercised for the purpose of maintaining custody, security, and control of any prisoner being transported inside and outside this state as authorized by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act and the Interstate Corrections Compact. &nbsp;The Director may implement policies that place additional limitations on the authority of correctional peace officers. &nbsp;The Director shall issue an identification card to each correctional peace officer that identifies the person as a correctional peace officer and grants the person the authority to carry a firearm and make arrests pursuant to this paragraph. &nbsp;Should a correctional peace officer terminate employment for any reason, fail to remain qualified as a correctional peace officer or for reasons stated in policies of the Department, the correctional peace officer shall return the identification card to the supervisor of the correctional peace officer immediately;</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;To develop and implement, upon approval of the State Board of Corrections, a basic course of instruction for correctional officers that consists of a training academy that provides not less than two hundred (200) hours of core curriculum instruction and a firearms training program that provides not less than twenty (20) hours of instruction. &nbsp;The basic course of instruction shall be subject to the following:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;the minimum qualifying score that must be shot to pass the firearms training program shall be equal to the minimum qualifying score required by the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training for peace officers, and</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;the Director may waive any number of hours or courses required to complete the basic course of instruction for any person who, in the opinion of the Director, has received sufficient training or experience that such hours of instruction would be unduly burdensome or duplicative; however, completion of the firearms training program shall not be waived;</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;To develop and implement annual in-service training for correctional officers that consists of at least forty (40) hours of continued corrections education and annual recertification of firearms proficiency. &nbsp;The minimum qualifying score that must be shot to requalify for recertification of firearms proficiency shall be equal to the minimum qualifying score required by the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training for the requalification of peace officers;</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;To require any person employed as a correctional security officer, correctional security manager, correctional chief of security, and chief of security to remain qualified as a correctional peace officer. &nbsp;Any correctional peace officer who is unable to remain qualified as a correctional peace officer may be offered an available position within the Department in the same or lesser pay grade for which the employee is eligible, or the employee may be terminated. &nbsp;When an employee who is commissioned as a correctional peace officer by the Department voluntarily moves into a position which does not require correctional peace officer status, the Director may allow the employee to maintain his or her correctional peace officer status;</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;To authorize other employees of the Department to carry firearms anywhere in the state to use for self-defense pursuant to and consistent with policies developed by the Department upon satisfactory completion of the firearms training program provided for in paragraph 4 of this subsection. &nbsp;The Director shall issue an identification card to each authorized employee that grants the employee the authority to carry a firearm pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. &nbsp;Should an authorized employee terminate employment for any reason, fail to remain qualified to carry a firearm, or for reasons stated in the policies of the Department, the authorized employee shall immediately return the identification card to the supervisor of the employee and shall no longer be authorized to carry firearms under the authority of this paragraph;</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;To maintain such industries, factories, plants, shops, farms, and other enterprises and operations, hereinafter referred to as prison industries, at each penal institution as the State Board of Corrections deems necessary or appropriate to employ the prisoners or teach skills, or to sustain the penal institution; and as provided for by policies established by the State Board of Corrections, to allow compensation for the work of the prisoners, and to provide for apportionment of inmate wages, the amounts thus allowed to be kept in accounts by the Board for the prisoners and given to the inmates upon discharge from the penal institution, or, upon an order, paid to their families or dependents or used for the personal needs of the prisoners. &nbsp;Any industry that employs prisoners shall be deemed a State Prison Industry if the prisoners are paid from state funds including the proceeds of goods sold as authorized by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=440583">Section 123f of Title 74</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. &nbsp;Any industry in which wages of prisoners are paid by a nongovernmental person, group, or corporation, except those industries employing prisoners in work-release centers under the authority of the Department of Corrections, shall be deemed a Private Prison Industry;</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;To assign residences at each penal institution to penal institutional personnel and their families;</p>

<p>10. &nbsp;To provide for the education, training, vocational education, rehabilitation, and recreation of prisoners;</p>

<p>22. &nbsp;To provide reintegration referral services to any person discharged from the state custody who has volunteered to receive reintegration referral services. &nbsp;The Director may assign staff to refer persons discharged from state custody to services. &nbsp;The Director shall promulgate rules for the referral process. &nbsp;All reintegration referral services shall be subject to the availability of funds;</p>
