<P>1. The name of the person and all aliases used or under which the person has been known;</P>
<P>2. A complete description of the person, including a photograph and fingerprints, and when requested by the Department of Corrections, such registrant shall submit to a blood or saliva test for purposes of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile. Submission to testing for individuals registering shall be within thirty (30) days of registration. Registrants who already have valid samples on file in the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) DNA Offender Database shall not be required to submit duplicate samples for testing;</P>
<P>3. The offenses listed in <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=84014">Section 582</A> of this title for which the person has been convicted or the person received a suspended sentence or any form of probation, where the offense was committed, where the person was convicted or received the suspended sentence or any form of probation, and the name under which the person was convicted or received the suspended sentence or probation;</P>
<P>4. The name and location of each hospital or penal institution to which the person was committed for each offense listed in <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=84014">Section 582</A> of this title;</P>
<P>5. Where the person previously resided, where the person currently resides including a mappable address and a zip code, how long the person has resided there, how long the person expects to reside there, and how long the person expects to remain in the county and in this state. The address of the residence shall be a physical address, not a post office box. The Department of Corrections shall conduct address verification of each registered sex offender as follows:</P>
<P>a. on an annual basis, if the numeric risk level of the person is one,</P>
<P>b. on a semiannual basis, if the numeric risk level of the person is two, or</P>
<P>c. every ninety (90) days, if the offender has been determined to be a habitual or aggravated sex offender by the Department of Corrections or has been assigned a level assignment of three.</P>
<P>The Department of Corrections shall mail a nonforwardable verification form to the last-reported address of the person. The person shall return the verification form in person to the local law enforcement authority of that jurisdiction within ten (10) days after receipt of the form and may be photographed by the local law enforcement authority at that time; provided that the person shall be photographed by the local law enforcement authority at that time if the photograph in the Department of Corrections sex offender registry is more than one year old, or if it cannot be determined when the photograph in the registry was taken. The local law enforcement authority shall require the person to produce proof of the identity of the person and a current mappable address with a zip code. Upon confirming the information contained within the verification form, the local law enforcement authority shall forward a copy of the form to the Department of Corrections, in a manner approved by the Department of Corrections, within three (3) days after receipt of the form.

A local law enforcement authority designated as the primary registration authority of the person may, at any time, mail a nonforwardable verification form to the last-reported address of the person.

The local law enforcement authority shall require the person to produce proof of the identity of the person and a current mappable address with a zip code;</P>

The Department of Corrections shall promptly provide all municipal police departments, all county sheriff departments and all campus police departments a list of those sex offenders registered and living in their county.</P>
<P>J. The Department of Corrections shall, upon the request of any Internet entity, release to such entity any information required pursuant to paragraph 9 of subsection A of this section or paragraph 5 of subsection D of this section that would enable the Internet entity to prescreen or remove sex offenders from its services or, in conformity with state and federal law, advise law enforcement or other governmental entities of potential violations of law or threats to public safety. Before releasing information to an Internet entity the Department shall require an Internet entity that requests information to submit to the Department the name, address and telephone number of such entity and the specific legal nature and corporate status of such entity. Except for the purposes specified in this subsection, an Internet entity shall not publish or in any way disclose or redisclose any information provided to it by the Department pursuant to this subsection. The Department shall update any information released pursuant to this subsection on a monthly basis to ensure that the information of every individual that has been removed from the sex offender registry in this state is no longer released pursuant to this subsection. The Department may charge the Internet entity a fee for access to information pursuant to this subsection. The Department shall promulgate any rules necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection.

<P>L. The State Commissioner of Health is authorized to distribute information from the sex offender registry to any nursing home or long-term care facility.

<P>M. Each local law enforcement authority shall make its sex offender registry available upon request, without restriction, at a cost that is no more than what is charged for other records provided by the local law enforcement authority pursuant to the Oklahoma Open Records Act.</P>
<P>When a local law enforcement authority sends a copy of or otherwise makes the sex offender registry available to any public or private school offering any combination of prekindergarten through twelfth grade classes or child care facility licensed by the state, the agency shall provide a notice using the following or similar language: "A person whose name appears on this registry has been convicted of a sex offense. Continuing to employ a person whose name appears on this registry may result in civil liability for the employer or criminal prosecution pursuant to <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=103940">Section 589 of Title 57</A> of the Oklahoma Statutes."</P>
