<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT size=2><FONT size=2><FONT size=2>
<P><FONT face=Arial>A. Except as provided for in subsection B of this section, a 
private prison contractor may contract with the federal </FONT></FONT><FONT 
face=Arial>government or another state to provide for housing, care and control 
of inmates, as provided in this section, who are in the custody of the United 
States or another state, except for inmates who have histories of escape from 
medium or maximum security level correctional facilities for adults, who have a 
felony conviction for rioting, who are sentenced to terms of incarceration for 
conviction of a sex-related offense, or who are incarcerated with a sentence of 
death, within a facility owned or operated by the private prison contractor. 
Private prison contractors shall not provide for the housing, care and control 
of detainees designated as enemy combatants by the federal government, or who 
are under federal, state or local investigation, charge, or conviction for 
crimes of international terrorism or conspiracy to commit international 
terrorism or acts of hostile aggression against the United States or allies of 
the United States. Such private prison contractor may perform other functions 
related to such responsibilities.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>B. A private prison contractor operating a facility on 
January 1, 2004, at twenty-five percent (25%) or less capacity may contract with 
the federal government or another state to provide for housing, care and control 
of inmates provided the facility would be allowed to house the same type of 
inmates if contracting with this state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>C. Any offense which would be a crime if committed within a 
state correctional institution of this state shall be a crime if committed in a 
facility owned or operated by a private prison contractor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>D. 1. A private prison contractor shall not employ any 
personnel convicted of a felony if the person has been incarcerated in the 
private prison facility for which an application for employment is being 
considered; provided, a private prison contractor may employ personnel convicted 
of drug-related felonies who have been rehabilitated for programs for drug or 
other substance abuse rehabilitation for inmates of the facility.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>2. Any personnel of a facility owned or operated by a 
private prison contractor, except any person convicted of a felony offense, 
shall be authorized to carry and use firearms while in the performance of their 
official duties only in the manner provided in this subsection and only after 
completing training approved by the Council on Law Enforcement Education and 
Training. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training may charge a 
reasonable fee for its cost of evaluating firearms training for private prison 
personnel. Private prison personnel shall only be authorized to use firearms for 
the following purposes:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>a. to prevent escape from the facility or from custody while 
being transported to or from the facility. As used in this paragraph, "to 
prevent escape from the facility" means to prevent an incarcerated individual 
from crossing the secure perimeter of the facility, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>b. to prevent an act which would cause death or serious 
bodily injury to any person.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>3. The Department of Corrections is authorized to provide 
training to personnel of the private prison contractor, pursuant to contract. 
The Department of Corrections shall charge a reasonable fee for the training, 
not to exceed the cost of such training. The provisions of this subsection shall 
not be construed to confer peace officer status upon any employee of the private 
prison contractor or to authorize the use of firearms, except as provided in 
this subsection.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>4. All private prisons operating in this state shall prepare 
a written emergency plan and mutual aid agreement between the private prison 
facility and state and local law enforcement agencies, including the Department 
of Corrections and the Department of Public Safety.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>5. If an inmate escapes from the facility, or in the event 
of any riot or other serious disturbance, personnel from the facility 
immediately shall inform the Department of Corrections, the Department of Public 
Safety, the county sheriff and, if the facility is located within the boundaries 
of a municipality, the police department of the municipality.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>6. The Department of Corrections shall designate facilities 
operated by the Department to provide support in the event of a riot, escape or 
other serious emergency. Personnel from the facility shall inform the Department 
of Corrections, pursuant to Department policy, if there is any incident. The 
Department of Corrections is directed to respond on behalf of public safety of 
this state. The private prison contractor shall provide the Department of 
Corrections access to the facility and secure facility space to establish a 
command post, including provisions for telephone and fax access. Any emergency 
response provided by any state or local law enforcement agency shall be at the 
sole expense of the private prison contractor/operator. Each responding agency 
shall submit a written invoice detailing costs incurred which shall be paid 
within thirty (30) days of receipt by the private prison 
contractor/operator.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>E. If an inmate is to be released or discharged from 
incarceration, is released or discharged by any court order, is to be placed on 
probation, is paroled, or if the federal government or sending state requests 
transfer or the return of the inmate, the private prison contractor immediately 
shall transfer or return the inmate to the sending state which has legal 
authority over the sentence or, in the case of federal inmates, to the closest 
federal prison or to the federal authority of the state in which federal custody 
over the inmate originated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>F. A private prison contractor housing federal inmates from 
jurisdictions other than Oklahoma, or inmates sentenced pursuant to the legal 
authority of another state, shall not allow any such inmate to leave the 
premises of the facility, except to comply with an order to appear in a court of 
competent jurisdiction, to receive medical care not available at the facility, 
to work as provided in subsection G of this section, or to return or be 
transferred to another state as provided by the provisions of subsection E of 
this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>G. A private prison contractor may allow minimum security 
inmate labor to be used in public works projects provided all of the following 
conditions are satisfied:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>1. The public works project must be in and for the county 
where the private prison is located or a county adjacent to the county where the 
private prison is located, or in and for a municipality in the county where the 
private prison is located or an adjacent county;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>2. The private prison contractor has developed security 
procedures which will ensure the safety of the public and the Department of 
Corrections has approved such procedures;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>3. The public works project has been authorized by the 
Department of Corrections and the county or municipal authorities where the 
public works project is located;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>4. The private prison contractor has procured and has in 
force and effect a policy of liability insurance which will provide coverage in 
an amount determined by the Department of Corrections for any loss resulting 
from the acts or omissions of inmates participating in such project or employees 
of the private prison contractor and for any injuries occurring to the inmates 
or employees; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>5. The use of federal inmates for public works projects will 
be in strict compliance with the provisions of Section 4002 of Title 18 of the 
United States Code and any other applicable provisions of federal 
law.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>H. A private prison contractor housing federal inmates or 
inmates of another state shall be responsible for the reimbursement of all 
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by this state or a political subdivision 
of this state for legal actions brought in this state by or on behalf of any 
federal inmate or inmate of another state while incarcerated in the facility, 
including court costs, sheriff mileage fees, witness fees, district attorney 
expenses, expenses of the office of Attorney General, indigent or public 
defender fees and costs, judicial expenses, court reporter expenses and any 
other costs, fees, or expenses associated with the proceedings or 
actions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I. A private prison contractor shall not house inmates from 
this state with federal inmates or inmates from another state, unless segregated 
or otherwise housed in such a manner as to satisfy the Director of the 
Department of Corrections.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>J. The State of Oklahoma shall not assume jurisdiction or 
custody of any federal inmate or inmate from another state housed in a facility 
owned or operated by a private prison contractor. Such inmates from another 
state shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of that state and 
federal inmates shall at all times be subject to federal jurisdiction. This 
state shall not be liable for loss resulting from the acts of such inmates nor 
shall this state be liable for any injuries to the inmates.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>K. Prior to contracting for the housing of any federal 
inmate or inmate from another state, the private prison contractor shall give 
the Department of Corrections first right to contract for placement of inmates 
under the custody of the Department of Corrections in the available capacity of 
the private prison facility.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>L. Prior to housing maximum security inmates in the custody 
of the United States or another state, the private prison contractor shall 
receive authorization from the Department of Corrections to house maximum 
security inmates at the facility. Authorization granted by the Department of 
Corrections shall be based on facility design and physical plant security 
requirements consistent with standards established by the American Correctional 
Association or the physical plant security requirements of the Department at 
Department-operated maximum security facilities. Upon request by a private 
prison contractor for all or a part of a facility to be granted authorization to 
house maximum security inmates, the Department shall complete an assessment 
within thirty (30) days. The assessment shall either result in authorization 
being granted to the private prison contractor or shall provide detailed 
requirements that shall be met by the facility in order for authorization to be 
granted.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>M. At least ten (10) business days prior to the transfer of 
inmates who are in the custody of the United States or another state to a 
private prison facility operating in the State of Oklahoma, the private prison 
contractor shall provide the Department of Corrections with the following 
information:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>1. The number of inmates to be transferred;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>2. The name of each inmate to be transferred;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>3. The date of transfer of the inmate;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>4. The security level of each inmate to be transferred, as 
determined by the sentencing state;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>5. The facility to which the inmate shall be transferred; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>6. The criminal history and institutional behavioral record 
for each inmate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The information provided pursuant to this subsection shall 
not be public record until the transfer of the inmate is complete. The records 
shall thereafter be made public only to the extent required by state 
law.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>N. The Department of Corrections shall have thirty (30) days 
after receipt of the information required in accordance with subsection M of 
this section to determine whether an inmate transferred to a private prison 
facility is compliant with the conditions of subsection A or B of this section. 
If the Department determines that an inmate housed at a private prison facility 
is not compliant with the conditions provided for in subsection A or B of this 
section, the Department shall notify the private prison contractor. Notification 
by the Department shall include the name of the inmate and reason why the inmate 
does not qualify to be housed at the facility to which the inmate has been 
transferred or housed within the State of Oklahoma. The private prison 
contractor shall either provide supplemental information verifying compliance 
with subsection A or B of this section, or shall transfer the inmate out of the 
State of Oklahoma within thirty (30) days of receiving said notification from 
the Department. Failure of the Department to review the inmate information 
provided pursuant to subsection M of this section shall not prevent the transfer 
of inmates into the State of Oklahoma for housing at a private prison 
facility.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>O. The provisions of subsection A, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 
6 of subsection D, paragraphs 2, 3, 5 and 6 of subsection M and subsection N of 
this section shall not apply to a private prison contractor that has a direct 
contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons of the United States Department of 
Justice for a facility that houses federal inmates and is monitored on-site by 
federal agency staff.</FONT></P>
