<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Governor of Oklahoma is hereby authorized and 
requested to execute, on behalf of the State of Oklahoma, with any other state 
or states legally joining therein a compact which shall be in form substantially 
as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The contracting states solemnly agree 
that:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article I</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The party states, desiring by common action to fully 
utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs 
for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, 
declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such 
facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, and with the 
federal government, thereby serving the best interest of such offenders and of 
society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. 
The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and 
execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and 
rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material 
resources.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article II</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As used in this compact, unless the context clearly 
requires otherwise:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. "State" means a state of the United States, the 
United States of America, a territory or possession of the United States, the 
District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. "Sending state" means a state party to this 
compact in which conviction or court commitment was had;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. "Receiving state" means a state party to this 
compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which 
conviction or court commitment was had;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. "Inmate" means a male or female offender who is 
committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. "Institution" means any penal or correctional 
facility including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or 
mentally defective, in which inmates may lawfully be confined.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article III</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Each party state may make one or more contracts 
with any one or more of the other party states, or with the federal government, 
for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions 
situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide 
for:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Its duration;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Payments to be made to the receiving state or to 
the federal government, by the sending state for inmate maintenance, 
extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt 
by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or 
treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if 
any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account 
thereof, and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products 
resulting therefrom;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Delivery and retaking of inmates; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Such other matters as may be necessary and 
appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending 
and receiving states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The terms and provisions of this compact shall be 
a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto and 
nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article IV</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a 
state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to 
subsection C of this section shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an 
inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is 
necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an 
appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct 
that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other 
party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the 
sending state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The appropriate officials of any state party to 
this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in 
which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of 
inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be 
confined in the institution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the 
terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the 
sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison 
or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another 
institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to 
confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any 
other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state, provided that the 
sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required 
pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article 
III, subsection A.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Each receiving state shall provide regular reports 
to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions 
pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify 
said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each 
inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering 
the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in 
the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for 
the sending state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. All inmates who may be confined in an institution 
pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and 
humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the 
receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of 
confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any 
legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate 
institution of the sending state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate 
confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending 
state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of 
the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state 
shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the 
appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings 
are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that 
of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by 
the sending state shall be made. Said record, together with any recommendations 
of the hearing officials, shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or 
officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in 
the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of 
this subsection, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents 
of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter 
except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall 
be released within the territory of the sending state, unless the inmate and the 
sending and receiving states shall agree upon release in some other place. The 
sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this 
compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits 
or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or 
his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have 
participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state 
located within such state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. The parents, guardian, trustee or other person or 
persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise or 
otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or 
restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined 
pursuant to the terms of this compact.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article V</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Any decision of the sending state in respect to 
any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be 
conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the 
time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the 
receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any 
criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within 
such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the 
consent of the receiving state until discharge from prosecution or other form of 
proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited 
officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant 
to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without 
interference.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. An inmate who escapes from an institution in which 
he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the 
sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the 
case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, 
the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall 
be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to 
prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction 
directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article VI</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Any state party to this compact may accept federal 
aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is 
or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto; and any 
inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such 
federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states 
have made contractual provision, provided that if such program or activity is 
not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the 
appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article VII</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This compact shall enter into force and become 
effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into 
law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and 
become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action 
by such state.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article VIII</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This compact shall continue in force and remain 
binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the 
same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from 
the compact to the appropriate official of all other party states. An actual 
withdrawal shall not take effect until one (1) year after the notice provided in 
said statute has been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing 
state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of 
withdrawal. Before effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall 
remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have 
confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article IX</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed 
to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may 
have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of 
inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of 
cooperative institutional arrangements.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article X</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The provisions of this compact shall be liberally 
construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision 
of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any 
participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any 
government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the 
remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, 
agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact 
shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, 
the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and 
in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable 
matters.</FONT></P><B><I>
