<FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>A. No person shall have an asbestos claim placed on any active trial roster 
in this state, or brought to trial in this state, or conduct discovery in an 
asbestos claim in this state, in the absence of a prima facie showing of 
asbestos-related malignancy or impairment as shown by service on each defendant 
of the information listed in either paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection:</P>
<P>1. A report by a physician who is board-certified in pulmonary medicine, 
occupational medicine, internal medicine, oncology, or pathology at the time of 
issuing the relevant medical report concluding:</P>
<P>a. the exposed person has been diagnosed with mesothelioma or other 
asbestos-related malignancy,</P>
<P>b. to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, exposure to asbestos was a 
proximate cause of the diagnosed mesothelioma or other asbestos-related 
malignancy, accompanied by a conclusion that the exposed person's medical 
findings were not more probably the result of other causes revealed by the 
exposed person's employment and medical history. A conclusion that the exposed 
person's physical impairment or impairments are "consistent with" or "compatible 
with" mesothelioma or other asbestos-related malignancy does not meet the 
requirements of this section, and</P>
<P>c. for malignant asbestos-related conditions other than mesothelioma, that 
the exposed person has an underlying nonmalignant asbestos-related condition and 
that at least fifteen (15) years have elapsed between the date of first exposure 
to asbestos and the date of diagnosis of the malignancy; or</P>
<P>2. A report by a physician who is board-certified in pulmonary medicine, 
internal medicine, occupational medicine, or pathology that:</P>
<P>a. the exposed person has been diagnosed with a nonmalignant asbestos-related 
condition, and</P>
<P>b. confirms that a physician actually treating or who treated the exposed 
person, or who has or who had a doctor-patient relationship with the exposed 
person or a medical professional employed by and under the direct supervision 
and control of such physician:</P>
<P>(1) performed a physical examination of the exposed person, or if the exposed 
person is deceased, reviewed available records relating to the exposed person's 
medical condition,</P>
<P>(2) took an occupational and exposure history from the exposed person or from 
a person knowledgeable about the alleged exposure or exposures that form the 
basis of the action, and</P>
<P>(3) took a medical and smoking history that includes a review of the exposed 
person's significant past and present medical problems relevant to the exposed 
person's impairment or disease,</P>
<P>c. sets out sufficient details of the exposed person's occupational, 
exposure, medical, and smoking history to form the basis for a medical diagnosis 
of an asbestos-related condition and confirms that at least fifteen (15) years 
have elapsed between the exposed person's first exposure to asbestos and the 
date of diagnosis,</P>
<P>d. confirms that the exposed person has a pathological diagnosis of 
asbestosis graded 1(B) or higher under the criteria published in 
"Asbestos-Associated Diseases", 106 Archives of Pathology and Laboratory 
Medicine 11, Appendix 3 (October 8, 1982), as amended from time to time, or</P>
<P>e. confirms that the exposed person's chest x-ray shows bilateral small 
irregular opacities (s, t, or u) with a profusion grading of 2/2 or higher on 
the ILO system of classification, or</P>
<P>f. confirms that the exposed person has radiological evidence of asbestosis 
and/or pleural thickening showing:</P>
<P>(1) bilateral small irregular opacities (s, t, or u) with a profusion grading 
of 1/1 or higher, or</P>
<P>(2) bilateral diffuse pleural thickening graded extent b2 or higher, 
including blunting of the costophrenic angle, and</P>
<P>g. (1) confirms that in cases described in subparagraph d or f of this 
paragraph, the exposed person has or had physical impairment rated at least 
Class 2 pursuant to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 
(5th Edition) (dated November 2000) demonstrating:</P>
<P>(a) forced vital capacity below the lower limit of normal and FEV1/FVC ratio 
(using actual values) at or above the lower limit of normal, or</P>
<P>(b) total lung capacity, by plethysmography or timed gas dilution, below the 
lower limit of normal, or</P>
<P>(c) if the claimant's medical condition or process prevents the pulmonary 
function test from being performed or makes the results of such test an 
unreliable indicator of physical impairment, a board-certified physician in 
pulmonary medicine, occupational medicine, internal medicine, oncology, or 
pathology, independent from the physician providing the report required herein, 
must provide a report which states to a reasonable degree of medical certainty 
that the claimant has a nonmalignant asbestos-related condition causing physical 
impairment equivalent to subdivision (a) or (b) of this division and states the 
reasons why the pulmonary function test would be an unreliable indicator of 
physical impairment.</P>
<P>(2) Alternatively and not to be used in conjunction with subdivision (c) of 
division (1) of this subparagraph, if an exposed person's medical conditions or 
processes prevent a physician from being able to diagnose or evaluate that 
exposed person sufficiently to make a determination as to whether that exposed 
person meets the requirements of subparagraph f of this paragraph, the claimant 
may serve on each defendant a report by a physician who is board-certified in 
pulmonary medicine, occupational medicine, internal medicine, oncology, or 
pathology at the time the report was made that:</P>
<P>(a) verifies that the physician has or had a doctor-patient relationship with 
the exposed person, and</P>
<P>(b) verifies that the exposed person has asbestos-related pulmonary 
impairment as demonstrated by pulmonary function testing showing:</P>
<P>(i) forced vital capacity below the lower limit of normal and total lung 
capacity, by plethysmography, below the lower limit of normal, or</P>
<P>(ii) forced vital capacity below the lower limit of normal and FEV1/FVC ratio 
(using actual values) at or above the lower limit of normal, and</P>
<P>(c) verifies that the exposed person has a chest x-ray and computed 
tomography scan or high-resolution computed tomography scan read by the 
physician or a physician who is board-certified in pulmonary medicine, 
occupational medicine, internal medicine, oncology, pathology, or radiology 
showing either bilateral pleural disease or bilateral parenchymal disease 
diagnosed and reported as being a consequence of asbestos exposure,</P>
<P>h. confirms that the physician has concluded that the exposed person's 
medical findings and impairment were not more probably the result of causes 
other than asbestos exposure as revealed by the exposed person's occupational, 
exposure, medical, and smoking history, and</P>
<P>i. is accompanied by the relevant radiologist's reports, pulmonary function 
tests, including printouts of all data, flow volume loops, and other information 
to the extent such has been performed demonstrating compliance with the 
equipment, quality, interpretation, and reporting standards set out in the 
Asbestos and Silica Claims Priorities Act, lung volume tests, diagnostic imaging 
of the chest, pathology reports, or other testing reviewed by the physician in 
reaching the physician's conclusions. Upon request, the relevant computed 
tomography scans and/or chest x-rays will be made available for review.</P>
<P>B. The detailed occupational and exposure history required herein must 
describe:</P>
<P>1. The exposed person's principal employments where it was likely there was 
exposure to airborne contaminants (including asbestos, silica, and other 
disease-causing dusts, mists, fumes, and airborne contaminants) that can cause 
pulmonary injury; and</P>
<P>2. Identification of the general nature, duration, and frequency of the 
exposed person's exposure to airborne contaminants, including asbestos and other 
dusts that can cause pulmonary injury.</P>
<P>C. All evidence and reports used in presenting the prima facie showing 
required in this section, including pulmonary function testing and diffusing 
studies, if any:</P>
<P>1. Must comply with the technical recommendations for examinations, testing 
procedures, quality assurance, quality controls, and equipment in the AMA's 
Guidelines to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment and the most current 
version of the Official Statements of the American Thoracic Society regarding 
lung function testing. Testing performed in a hospital or other medical facility 
that is fully licensed and accredited by all appropriate regulatory bodies in 
the state in which the facility is located is presumed to meet the requirements 
of this act. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence demonstrating that the 
accreditation or licensing of the hospital or other medical facility has lapsed, 
or providing specific facts demonstrating that the technical recommendations for 
examinations, testing procedures, quality assurance, quality control, and 
equipment have not been followed;</P>
<P>2. Must not be obtained through testing or examinations that violate any 
applicable law, regulation, licensing requirement, or medical code of 
practice;</P>
<P>3. Must not be obtained under the condition that the exposed person retains 
legal services in exchange for the examination, testing, or screening;</P>
<P>4. Shall not result in any presumption at trial that the exposed person is 
impaired by an asbestos or silica-related condition; and</P>
<P>5. Shall not be conclusive as to the liability of any defendant.</P>
<P>D. The conclusion that a prima facie showing has been made is not admissible 
at trial.</P></FONT>
