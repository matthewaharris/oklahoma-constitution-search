style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Upon commencement of a suit, action or proceeding 
to foreclose or otherwise enforce the remedies in any mortgage, contract for 
deed or deed of trust in a court of competent jurisdiction, if the 
plaintiff/mortgagee believes, knows, or has reason to know, that the subject 
property is abandoned or vacated and, as a result of such 
abandonment:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Physical deterioration and devaluation of the 
property is occurring or has occurred;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. There exists a risk to the health, safety or 
welfare of the public, or any adjoining or adjacent property owners, due to 
potential or actual acts of vandalism, loitering, criminal conduct or the 
physical destruction or deterioration of the property; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. There exists a risk of additional legal process 
for violation of law, ordinance, unpaid taxes or accrual of liens, the 
plaintiff/mortgagee may seek a court order to protect and preserve the property 
pending the disposition of the suit, action or proceeding before the 
court.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. A motion to protect and preserve an abandoned or 
vacated property subject to a suit, action or proceeding to foreclose or 
otherwise enforce the remedies in the mortgage, contract for deed or deed of 
trust shall be filed and heard in accordance with court rules and statutory 
civil procedures for motions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The plaintiff/mortgagee, after filing a motion to 
protect and preserve property in the pending litigation before the court, and 
having received from the court a date, time and location to hear the motion, 
shall present a certified copy of the motion and hearing notice to the sheriff 
in the county in which the property is located. The sheriff, upon receiving a 
written request to post a motion and hearing notice on a property within his or 
her jurisdiction, shall within three (3) days of the receipt of such request, 
physically inspect the subject property and determine whether or not the 
property is abandoned or occupied. At the time of the physical inspection of the 
property, the sheriff shall either post a copy of the motion and hearing notice 
in a conspicuous place on the property or shall physically serve an occupant of 
the property as required by the provisions of this section. The sheriff shall 
receive from the plaintiff/mortgagee a sheriffs service fee not to exceed One 
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) for the inspection of each property and may 
designate a deputy or reserve deputy to perform the inspection and posting or 
service specified in this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Upon physical inspection, if the sheriff 
determines the property to be abandoned or vacated, the sheriff shall post the 
required motion and hearing notice on the property and make a return of 
inspection and posting to the plaintiff/mortgagee at the address provided by the 
plaintiff/mortgagee. In the event, the property is occupied or appears to be 
occupied in the judgment of the sheriff, the sheriff shall attempt actual 
service of the motion and hearing notice on an occupant of the property as 
provided for service of summons, and if a person is not available to accept 
service or cannot be found, the sheriff shall post the motion and hearing notice 
in a conspicuous place on the property and make a written return of inspection 
and service to the plaintiff/mortgagee at the address provided by the 
plaintiff/mortgagee.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The sheriffs written return of inspection and 
posting or return of inspection and service shall be made within three (3) days 
of the date of actual inspection. The return shall be deposited into the regular 
U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and the return document shall certify 
that:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The motion and hearing notice was either served in 
person upon an occupant of the property or was physically posted on the property 
and the exact date of service or posting;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A physical inspection and observation of the 
property was conducted; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. In the best judgment and belief of the sheriff, or 
designee, the property was abandoned and vacated or occupied by the 
defendant/mortgagor or a lawful tenant or other person, and any reason or belief 
for that determination.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. The posting of the motion and hearing notice shall 
be deemed proper service and sufficient notice to the defendant/mortgagor and 
all occupants of the property for purposes of holding the hearing and 
authorizing the court to issue an order to protect and preserve the property 
pending disposition of the litigation before the court. The court shall not 
require any additional or alternative notification to the defendant/mortgagor or 
any occupant. Nothing shall prohibit the plaintiff/mortgagee from notifying, or 
attempting to notify, the defendant/mortgagor or any potential occupant of the 
subject property in another manner. If the plaintiff/mortgagee elects 
notification by publication in addition to the posting required by this section, 
he or she shall publish a copy of the motion and hearing notice at least twice 
in the fifteen-day period immediately preceding the hearing date in a 
publication of general circulation in the jurisdiction in which the property is 
located. A copy of the motion and hearing notice shall be sent or delivered to 
the defendants legal counsel of record as required by court rule and statutory 
civil procedure for notifying opposing counsel of motions and 
hearings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. The motion posted or served shall be in the form 
and style recognized for pleadings filed in the official court case, and shall 
contain the name of the parties, court case number, the date, time and place of 
the hearing, and a statement directing the defendant/mortgagor or any occupant 
of the property to appear in person, or through legal counsel, or be deemed to 
have abandoned and vacated the property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. No hearing shall be held on a motion to protect 
and preserve the property subject to a suit, action or proceeding to foreclose 
or enforce remedies in the mortgage, contract for deed or deed of trust, unless 
at least fifteen (15) days has passed from the date of posting or service of the 
motion and hearing notice. At the hearing, the court shall hear testimony of the 
parties present, including any person who claims to be an occupant or tenant of 
the property and who is not a named litigant in the pending litigation before 
the court. The testimony shall include inquiry into the propertys previous and 
current condition and the reasons or beliefs supporting or objecting to a 
determination that the property is abandoned or vacated. The court shall review 
the sheriffs written return of inspection and posting or the return of 
inspection and service. The court shall not require the presence of the 
defendant/mortgagor or defendants legal counsel to grant an order authorizing 
the plaintiff/mortgagee to take action to protect and preserve the subject 
property pending the disposition of the litigation before the court.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. If the defendant/mortgagor, or an occupant or 
tenant, appears in person or through legal counsel, and the court is satisfied 
that the defendant, or person, is physically residing in the property, or if not 
occupying the property is willing and able to properly protect and preserve the 
property pending the litigation before the court, the motion shall be denied. 
However, the court shall enter an order requiring the person to protect and 
preserve the property under such conditions as the court may determine. Failure 
of the person to comply with the court order to protect and preserve the 
property shall be contempt of court.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If the defendant/mortgagor, or an occupant or 
tenant, fails to appear in person, and there exists no compelling reason why the 
defendant/mortgagor, or person, could not appear in person, and the property 
appears to be deteriorating or at risk of deteriorating as a result of 
abandonment, vandalism or any unlawful or intentionally malicious act, the court 
shall enter an order directing the plaintiff/mortgagee to take action to protect 
and preserve the property pending and in anticipation of foreclosure or other 
enforcement of remedies in the mortgage, contract for deed or deed of 
trust.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Upon issuance of an order to protect and preserve 
property, the court shall direct the plaintiff/mortgagee to inventory, or cause 
to be an inventoried by an independent person, any personal property remaining 
on or about the subject property and to file such inventory in the court case 
file.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. When a court order is issued to protect and 
preserve property, the plaintiff/mortgagee shall be authorized to take, and 
shall take, possession and secure the property pending and in anticipation of 
foreclosure or other enforcement of remedies in the mortgage, contract for deed 
or deed of trust.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. An order issued to protect and preserve property 
pursuant to the provisions of this section may be vacated and set aside at any 
time by the court upon motion by the defendant/mortgagor, or occupant or tenant, 
and satisfactory proof that the property is not or was not abandoned or vacated, 
or was leased or rented and lawfully occupied by a person other than the 
defendant/mortgagor at the time of issuance of the order, provided, the property 
was not subjected to intentional malicious acts by the defendant, or person, to 
deface, destroy or devalue the property.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. A motion filed, or court order issued, to protect 
and preserve the property as provided in this section shall not alter, modify, 
relinquish or release any right, title or interests of any party in or to any 
property, or alter, modify, relinquish or release any partys position, 
standing, claims, defenses or objections in the suit, action or proceeding 
pending before the court to foreclose or enforce any remedy in the mortgage, 
contract for deed or deed of trust.</FONT></SPAN></FONT><SPAN
