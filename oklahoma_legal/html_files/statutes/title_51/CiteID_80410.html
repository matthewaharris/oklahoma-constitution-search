<P>A. The state or any political subdivision, subject to procedural requirements 
imposed by this section, other applicable statute, ordinance, resolution, or 
written policy, shall:</P>
<P>1. Provide a defense for any employee as defined in Section 152 of this title 
when liability is sought for any violation of property rights or any rights, 
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United 
States when alleged to have been committed by the employee while acting within 
the scope of employment;</P>
<P>2. Pay or cause to be paid any judgment entered in the courts of the United 
States, the State of Oklahoma or any other state against any employee or 
political subdivision or settlement agreed to by the political subdivision 
entered against any employee, and any costs or fees, for a violation of property 
rights or any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or 
laws of the United States which occurred while the employee was acting within 
the scope of employment. The maximum aggregate amount of indemnification paid 
directly from funds of the state or any political subdivision to or on behalf of 
any employee pursuant to this section shall not exceed the maximum figures 
authorized by the provisions of Section 154 of this title, regardless of the 
number of persons who suffer damage, injury or death as a result of the 
occurrence, unless, in the case of a political subdivision, the political 
subdivision establishes higher limits by ordinance, if a municipality, or, as to 
other political subdivisions, by resolution, published as required by law; 
and</P>
<P>3. For any cause of action filed against an employee on or after January 1, 
1990, post or cause to be posted any supersedeas or other bond ordered by the 
court.</P>
<P>B. 1. The state or a political subdivision shall not be required to indemnify 
any employee of the state or a political subdivision under the provisions of 
this section, unless the employee is judicially determined to be entitled to 
such indemnification and a final judgment therefor is entered. The exclusive 
means of recovering indemnification from the state shall be by filing an 
application for indemnification in the district court of the county where venue 
is proper as provided for in paragraph 2 of this subsection. The exclusive means 
of recovering indemnification from a political subdivision shall be by filing an 
application for indemnification in the trial court where the judgment was 
entered. If the federal trial court cannot hear the action, such application 
shall be filed in the district court of the county where the situs of the 
municipality is located. Actions to determine entitlement to indemnification 
shall be tried to the court, sitting without a jury.</P>
<P>2. Venue for actions to determine entitlement to indemnification from the 
state shall be in Oklahoma County, except that a constitutional state agency, 
board or commission may, upon a resolution being filed with the Secretary of 
State, designate another situs for venue in lieu of Oklahoma County.</P>
<P>3. All applications for indemnification from the state or a political 
subdivision shall be filed in the name of the real party or parties in interest, 
and in no event shall any application be presented nor recovery made under the 
right of subrogation. Indemnification from the state as provided for in this 
subsection shall extend only to acts or omissions occurring on or after January 
1, 1984. The employee of the state or a political subdivision must file an 
application for indemnification within thirty (30) days of final judgment, or 
the right to seek indemnification shall be lost forever.</P>
<P>4. In order to recover indemnification from the state or a political 
subdivision pursuant to this subsection, the court shall determine by a 
preponderance of the evidence that:</P>
<P>a. the employee reasonably cooperated in good faith in the defense of the 
action upon which the judgment or settlement was awarded and for which 
indemnification is sought;</P>
<P>b. the actions or omissions upon which such a judgment or settlement has been 
rendered were not the result of fraudulent conduct or corruption by the 
employee;</P>
<P>c. the employee, in committing the acts or omissions upon which a judgment or 
settlement has been rendered was acting in good faith and within any applicable 
written administrative policies known to the employee at the time of the 
omissions or acts alleged;</P>
<P>d. the employee was acting within the scope of employment at the time that 
the acts or omissions upon which a judgment or settlement has been rendered were 
committed by the employee;</P>
<P>e. the acts or omissions of the employee upon which a judgment or settlement 
has been rendered were not motivated by invidious discriminatory animus directed 
toward race, sex, or national origin; and</P>
<P>f. when punitive or exemplary damages are included in the total award 
rendered against the employee of a political subdivision, the indemnification 
amount sought for fees and costs does not include amounts attributable to the 
employee's defense against the punitive or exemplary damages in accordance with 
subsection D of this section.</P>
<P>5. a. Any indemnification judgment against the state under this section shall 
be an encumbrance against otherwise available unencumbered monies and 
unallocated unencumbered monies in the appropriations of the agency on whose 
behalf the employee to be indemnified was acting at the time of the act or 
omission upon which the judgment or settlement was awarded and for which 
indemnification was sought.</P>
<P>b. If sufficient unencumbered monies or unallocated unencumbered monies do 
not exist in the agency's appropriations to pay the indemnification, the agency 
shall make application to the Risk Management Division of the Office of 
Management and Enterprise Services for full payment of the indemnification out 
of the Risk Management Revolving Fund established pursuant to Section 85.58K of 
Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Payment out of this fund shall be authorized 
if there are sufficient monies greater than the sum total of the then pending 
fund indemnification judgment requests, and the reserves for future tort claims 
as certified by the Director of Risk Management.</P>
<P>c. If sufficient monies do not exist in the Tort Claims Liability Revolving 
Fund, the agency shall request the Legislature to make an appropriation 
sufficient to pay the indemnification.</P>
<P>d. Any indemnification judgment against a political subdivision shall be paid 
as provided in Sections 361 through 365.6 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma Statutes 
and Section 159 of this title.</P>
<P>C. The state or political subdivision shall have the right to recover from an 
employee the amount expended by the state or political subdivision to provide a 
defense, or pay a settlement agreed to by the employee and the state or 
political subdivision, or pay the final judgment, if it is shown that the 
employee's conduct which gave rise to the action was fraudulent or corrupt or if 
the employee fails to reasonably cooperate in good faith in defense of the 
action.</P>
<P>D. The state or a political subdivision shall not, under any circumstances, 
be responsible to pay or indemnify any employee for any punitive or exemplary 
damages rendered against the employee, nor to pay for any defense, judgment, 
settlement, costs, or fees which are paid or covered by any applicable policy or 
contract of insurance. Where any civil rights judgment upon which 
indemnification under subsection B of this section is applied for by an employee 
of the state includes an award for both actual and punitive or exemplary 
damages, the total amount of fees and costs for which indemnification may be 
allowed shall be limited to the percentage of fees and costs in the total award 
that the percentage of the award of actual damages bears to the total judgment 
awarded. It is the public policy of the State of Oklahoma that the state or a 
political subdivision may indemnify its employee for actual damages, fees, and 
costs as provided herein in any case in which the findings set out in paragraph 
B of this section have been determined.</P>
<P>E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to waive any immunities 
available to the state under the terms of the Eleventh Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States. Any immunity or other bar to a civil lawsuit 
under state or federal law shall remain in effect. The fact that the state or a 
political subdivision may relieve an employee from all judgments, settlements, 
costs, or fees arising from the civil lawsuit shall not, under any 
circumstances, be communicated to any trier of fact in the case of any trial by 
jury.</P>
