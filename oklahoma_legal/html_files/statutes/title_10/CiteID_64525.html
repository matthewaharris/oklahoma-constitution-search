<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. A consent to an adoption of a minor shall be in 
writing, recorded by a court reporter, and executed before a judge of the 
district court in this state and contain:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The date, place, and time of the execution of the 
consent;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The name and date of birth of the person executing 
the consent;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The current mailing address, telephone number, and 
social security number of the person executing the consent; and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Instructions that the consent is irrevocable, 
except upon the specific grounds specified in Section <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=64528">7503-2.7</A> of this title, upon which 
the consent can be revoked and the manner in which a motion to set aside the 
consent must be filed.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. A consent must state:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. That the person executing the document is 
voluntarily and unequivocally consenting to the adoption of the minor;</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. An understanding that after the consent is 
executed, it is final and, except for fraud or duress, may not be revoked or set 
aside for any reason except as otherwise authorized by the Oklahoma Adoption 
Code;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. That the person executing the consent is 
represented by counsel or has waived any right to counsel;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. That the execution of the consent does not 
terminate any duty of the person executing the consent to support the mother or 
the minor until the adoption is completed;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. That the person executing the consent has not 
received or been promised any money or anything of value for the consent, except 
for payments authorized by law;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Whether the individual executing the consent is a 
member of an Indian tribe and whether the minor is eligible for membership or 
the child is a member of an Indian tribe;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. That the person believes the adoption of the minor 
is in the minor's best interest; and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. That the person executing the consent has been 
advised that an adult adopted person born in Oklahoma, whose decree of adoption 
is finalized after November 1, 1997, may obtain a copy of such person's original 
certificate of birth unless affidavits of nondisclosure have been filed pursuant 
to Section <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=64526">7503-2.5</A> of this title 
and that the consenting parent may file an affidavit of nondisclosure.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Before executing a consent, a minor twelve (12) 
years of age or older must have been informed by the court of the meaning and 
consequences of the adoption and the availability of social and medical history 
information, pursuant to Section <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=64531">7504-1.2</A> of this title, when the 
minor turns eighteen (18) years of age.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. When it appears to the court that the parent or 
guardian executing a consent desires counsel but is indigent and cannot for that 
reason employ counsel, the court shall appoint counsel. In all counties having 
county indigent defenders, the county indigent defenders shall assume the duties 
of representation in such proceedings.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The transcript of the court proceedings pursuant 
to this section shall be placed in the court record.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Except as otherwise provided by subsection K of 
this section, verification of the court shall be in substantially the following 
form:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I, _______________, Judge of the District Court in 
and for __________ County, State of Oklahoma, a Court having original adoption 
jurisdiction, do hereby certify, that upon this day, __________ personally 
appeared in open Court, before me, and orally and in writing executed the above 
and foregoing Appearance and Consent to Adoption.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In executing this acknowledgement, I further certify 
that the said ___________ acknowledged that the person executed said consent to 
adoption freely and voluntarily, and that it was explained to such person by or 
before me, the undersigned Judge of the District Court, that in executing the 
consent the person was surrendering all parental authority whatsoever over the 
minor; and that with such explanation made to the consenting person by or before 
me, the undersigned Judge of the District Court, the person executed the 
consent, freely, voluntarily and intelligently for all uses and purposes therein 
set forth.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I further certify that it was explained to the 
consenting person that this consent is irrevocable and final except for fraud or 
duress and may not be revoked or set aside except and unless no Petition to 
Adopt is filed within nine (9) months after placement of the minor or if this or 
some other court decides not to terminate the rights of the other parent of the 
minor. I further certify that I am satisfied that the consenting person 
understands the consequences of an adoption; the consenting person has 
represented that such person has not received or been promised any money or 
anything of value for the giving of consent except for those payments authorized 
by law; the consenting person has represented that such person is not under the 
influence of alcohol or medication or other substance that affects the person's 
competence; the parent fully understood the English language and communicated in 
the English language at all times during said hearing, or all information was 
translated into the consenting person's language, and was fully understood by 
the person; and if the consenting person was the biological parent, such parent 
was advised regarding the affidavit of nondisclosure.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. A consent may be signed before any judge of a 
court having probate or adoption jurisdiction in this state or in the state of 
residence of the person executing the consent.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. 1. a. If an individual whose consent is necessary 
resides in a country or place other than the United States of America, other 
than a member of the United States Armed Services stationed abroad, the consent 
of the individual to the adoption may be obtained by a written instrument signed 
by such person and acknowledged before an officer of the legal subdivision of 
the government of the place of such person's residence who is authorized to 
administer oaths under the laws of such country or place.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. If the foreign country's government does not 
involve itself in adoption matters, the consent may be executed before an 
officer of the Judge Advocate General's Office of the United States Armed 
Services or before an officer of the United States Embassy located in that 
country, provided the execution of such consent is not a violation of the laws 
of the foreign country, or a violation of international law or treaty between 
the foreign country's government and the United States. The consent shall 
reflect that the consent is not given or accepted in violation of the laws of 
the foreign country or in violation of international law or treaty between such 
foreign country's government and the United States.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If an individual whose consent is necessary is a 
member of the United States Armed Services stationed in a country or place other 
than the United States, the individual's consent may be acknowledged before an 
officer of the Judge Advocate General's Office or other legal officer possessing 
the authority to administer oaths.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. If the written instrument containing a consent to 
adoption is written in a language other than the English language, the 
petitioner must have it translated into the English language by a qualified 
translator, and must file the original instrument together with the translation 
with the court. The translation must be sworn to as being a true and correct 
translation by the person translating the document.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. Except as otherwise required by subsection H of 
this section, when the person whose consent is or may be required resides 
outside of Oklahoma, the consent to adoption by such person may be executed in 
that state or country in the manner set forth in the Oklahoma Adoption Code or 
in the manner prescribed by the laws of the state or country of such person's 
residence.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. 1. When the person whose consent is required is 
the Director or designee of the Department of Human Services for minors in the 
custody of the Department of Human Services, the contents of the consent need 
only contain the full name of the person executing the consent, that the person 
executing the consent is duly authorized by the Director to consent to the 
adoption, the full name of the child being adopted, and the names and addresses 
of adoptive petitioners.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The verification of the court shall be in 
substantially the following form:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I, _______________, Judge of the District Court in 
and for __________ County, State of Oklahoma, a Court having original adoption 
jurisdiction, do hereby certify, that upon this day, __________ personally
