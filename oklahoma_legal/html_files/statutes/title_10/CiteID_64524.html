<DIR>
<DIR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I, ____________________, Judge of the District Court 
in and for _________________ County, State of Oklahoma, a Court having original 
adoption jurisdiction, do hereby certify, that upon this day, ________________ 
personally appeared in open Court, before me, and orally and in writing executed

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In executing this acknowledgment, I further certify 
that the said ___________________ acknowledged that the person executed said 
relinquishment to adoption freely and voluntarily, and that it was explained to 
such person by or before me, the undersigned Judge of the District Court, that 
in executing the relinquishment, the person was surrendering all parental 
authority whatsoever over the minor; and that with such explanation made to the 
person relinquishing the minor by or before me, the undersigned Judge of the 
District Court, the person executed the relinquishment, freely, voluntarily and 
intelligently for all uses and purposes therein set forth.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I further certify that it was explained to the 
relinquishing person that this relinquishment is irrevocable and final except 
for fraud or duress and may not be revoked or set aside except and unless no 
Petition to Adopt is filed within nine (9) months after placement of the minor 
or if this or some other court decides not to terminate the rights of the other 
parent of the minor. I further certify that I am satisfied that the 
relinquishing person understands the consequences of an adoption; the 
relinquishing person has represented that such person has not received or been 
promised any money or anything of value for the giving of the permanent 
relinquishment except for those payments authorized by law; the relinquishing 
person has represented that such person is not under the influence of alcohol or 
medication or any other substance that affects the person's competence; the 
person fully understood the English language and communicated in the English 
language at all times during said hearing, or all information was translated 
into the relinquishing person's language, and was fully understood by the 
person; and if the relinquishing person was the biological parent, such parent 
was advised regarding the affidavit of nondisclosure.</FONT> </P></DIR></DIR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. A permanent relinquishment shall be signed before 
any judge of a court having probate or adoption jurisdiction in this state or in 
the state of residence of the person executing the permanent 
relinquishment.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. 1. a. If an individual permanently relinquishing 
the child resides in a country or place other than the United States of America, 
other than a member of the United States Armed Services stationed abroad, the 
permanent relinquishment of the individual may be obtained by a written 
instrument signed by such person and acknowledged before an officer of the legal 
subdivision of the government of the place of such person's residence who is 
authorized to administer oaths under the laws of such country or place.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. If the foreign country's government does not 
involve itself in adoption matters, the permanent relinquishment may be executed 
before an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Office of the United States 
Armed Services or before an officer of the United States Embassy located in that 
country, provided the execution of a permanent relinquishment is not a violation 
of the laws of the foreign country, or a violation of international law or 
treaty between the foreign country's government and the United States. The 
permanent relinquishment shall reflect that the permanent relinquishment is not 
given or accepted in violation of the laws of the foreign country or in 
violation of international law or treaty between such foreign country's 
government and the United States.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If an individual permanently relinquishing the 
child is a member of the United States Armed Services stationed in a country or 
place other than the United States, the individual's permanent relinquishment 
may be acknowledged before an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Office or 
other legal officer possessing the authority to administer oaths.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. If the written instrument containing a permanent 
relinquishment is written in a language other than the English language, the 
petitioner must have it translated into the English language by a person 
qualified to do so, and must file the original instrument together with the 
translation with the court. The translation must be sworn to as being a true and 
correct translation by the person translating the document.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. Except as otherwise required by subsection I of 
this section, when the person permanently relinquishing the child for the 
purposes of adoption resides outside of Oklahoma, the permanent relinquishment 
by such person may be executed in that state or country in the manner set forth 
in the Oklahoma Adoption Code or in the manner prescribed by the laws of the 
state or country of such person's residence.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>L. 1. A court before which a permanent relinquishment 
has been executed may enter an order terminating parental rights of the parent 
of a child if such parent has executed a permanent relinquishment for adoption 
pursuant to the Oklahoma Adoption Code.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Any order terminating parental rights of a parent 
pursuant to this subsection shall state that the termination of parental rights 
shall not terminate the duty of the parent to support the child of such parent. 
The duty of the parent to support the child shall not be terminated until such 
time as a final decree of adoption has been entered.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Any proceedings held pursuant to this section 
shall not require the state as a necessary party.</FONT></P><B><I>
