<P>This Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance, hereinafter called "the 
compact", is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other 
jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE I. FINDINGS</P>
<P>The party states find that:</P>
<P>(1) In order to obtain adoptive families for children with special needs, 
prospective adoptive parents must be assured of substantial assistance (usually 
on a continuing basis) in meeting the high costs of supporting and providing for 
the special needs and services required by such children.</P>
<P>(2) The states have a fundamental interest in promoting adoption for children 
with special needs because the care, emotional stability and general support and 
encouragement required by such children to surmount their physical, mental or 
emotional conditions can be best, and often only, obtained in family homes with 
a normal parent-child relationship.</P>
<P>(3) The states obtain advantages from providing adoption assistance because 
the customary alternative is for the state to defray the entire cost of meeting 
all the needs of such children.</P>
<P>(4) The special needs involved are for the emotional, physical maintenance of 
the child, and medical support and services.</P>
<P>(5) The necessary assurance of adoption assistance for children with special 
needs, in those instances where children and adoptive parents are in states 
other than the one undertaking to provide the assistance, is to establish and 
maintain suitable substantive guarantees and workable procedures for interstate 
payments to assist with the necessary child maintenance, procurement of 
services, and medical assistance.</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE II. PURPOSES</P>
<P>The purposes of this compact are to:</P>
<P>(1) Strengthen protections for the interest of the children with special 
needs on behalf of whom adoption assistance is committed to be paid, when such 
children are in or move to states other than the one committed to make adoption 
assistance payments.</P>
<P>(2) Provide substantive assurances and procedures which will promote the 
delivery of medical and other services on an interstate basis to children 
through programs of adoption assistance established by the laws of the party 
states.</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE III. DEFINITIONS</P>
<P>As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different 
construction:</P>
<P>(1) "Child with special needs" means a minor who has not yet attained the age 
at which the state normally discontinues children's services or twenty-one (21) 
years, where the state determines that the child's mental or physical handicaps 
warrant the continuation of assistance, for whom the state has determined the 
following:</P>
<P>(A) That the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his or her 
parents; </P>
<P>(B) That there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or 
condition (such as his or her ethnic background, age, or membership in a 
minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical condition 
or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable 
to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without 
providing adoption assistance.</P>
<P>(C) That, except where it would be against the best interests of the child 
because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with 
prospective adoptive parents while in the care of such parents as a foster 
child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place the child 
with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance 
payments.</P>
<P>(2) "Adoption assistance" means the payment or payments for maintenance of a 
child, which payment or payments are made or committed to be made pursuant to 
the adoption assistance program established by the laws of a party state.</P>
<P>(3) "State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, or a Territory or Possession of the United States.</P>
<P>(4) "Adoption assistance state" means the state that is signatory to an 
adoption assistance agreement in a particular case.</P>
<P>(5) "Residence state" means the state of which the child is a resident by 
virtue of the residence of the adoptive parents.</P>
<P>(6) "Parents" means either the singular or plural of the word "parent".</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE IV. ADOPTION ASSISTANCE</P>
<P>(1) Each state shall determine the amounts of adoption assistance and other 
aid which it will give to children with special needs and their adoptive parents 
in accordance with its own laws and programs. The adoption assistance and other 
aid may be made subject to periodic re-evaluation of eligibility by the adoption 
assistance state in accordance with its laws. The provisions of this article and 
of Article V are subject to the limitation set forth in this paragraph.</P>
<P>(2) The adoption assistance and medical assistance services and benefits to 
which this compact applies are those provided to children with special needs and 
their adoptive parents from the time of the final decree of adoption or the 
interlocutory decree of adoption, as the case may be, pursuant to the laws of 
the adoptive assistance state. In addition to the content required by subsequent 
provisions of this article for adoption assistance agreements, each such 
agreement shall state whether the initial adoption assistance period thereunder 
begins with the final or interlocutory decree of adoption. Aid provided by party 
states to children with special needs during the preadoptive placement period or 
earlier shall be under the foster care or other programs of the states and, 
except as provided in paragraph 3 of this article, shall not be governed by the 
provisions of this compact.</P>
<P>(3) Every case of adoption assistance shall include an adoption assistance 
agreement between the adoptive parents and the agency of the state undertaking 
to provide the adoption assistance. Every such agreement shall contain 
provisions for the fixing of actual or potential interstate aspects of the 
adoption assistance, as follows:</P>
<P>(A) An express commitment that the adoption assistance shall be payable 
without regard for the state of residence of the adoptive parents, both at the 
outset of the agreement period and at all times during its continuance.</P>
<P>(B) A provision setting forth with particularity the types of child care and 
services toward which the adoption assistance state will make payments.</P>
<P>(C) A commitment to make medical assistance available to the child in 
accordance with Article V of this compact.</P>
<P>(D) An express declaration that the agreement is for the benefit of the 
child, the adoptive parents and the state and that it is enforceable by any or 
all of them.</P>
<P>(4) Any services or benefits provided by the residence state and the adoption 
assistance state for a child may be facilitated by the party states on each 
other's behalf. To this end, the personnel of the child welfare agencies of the 
party states will assist each other and beneficiaries of adoption assistance 
agreements with other party states in implementing benefits expressly included 
in adoption assistance agreements. However, it is recognized and agreed that in 
general children to whom adoption assistance agreements apply are eligible for 
benefits under the child welfare, education, rehabilitation, mental health and 
other programs of their state of residence on the same basis as other resident 
children.</P>
<P>(5) Adoption assistance payments, when made on behalf of a child who is 
subject to the jurisdiction of this state but residing in another state, shall 
be made on the same basis and in the same amounts as they would be made if the 
child were residing in this state; provided, however, adoption assistance 
agreements with families residing in other states signed before October 1, 2009, 
may be continued.</P>
<P>(6) Effective July 1, 2010, for good cause shown, the Director of the 
Department of Human Services or designee may approve adoption assistance 
payments on behalf of a child subject to the jurisdiction of this state but 
residing in another state, up to the maximum foster care reimbursement allowable 
in the state of residence.</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE V. MEDICAL ASSISTANCE</P>
<P>(1) Children for whom a party state is committed in accordance with the terms 
of an adoption assistance agreement to make adoption assistance payments are 
eligible for medical assistance during the entire period for which such payments 
are to be provided. Upon application therefor by the adoptive parents of a child 
on whose behalf a party state's duly constituted authorities have entered into 
an adoption assistance agreement, the adoptive parents shall receive a medical 
assistance identification made out in the child's name. The identification shall 
be issued by the medical assistance program of the residence state and shall 
entitle the child to the same benefits, pursuant to the same procedures, as any 
other child who is a resident of the state and covered by medical assistance, 
whether or not the adoptive parents are eligible for medical assistance.</P>
<P>(2) The identification shall bear no indication that an adoption assistance 
agreement with another state is the basis for issuance. However, if the 
identification is issued on account of an outstanding adoption assistance 
agreement to which another state is a signatory, the records of the issuing 
state and the adoption assistance state shall show the fact, shall contain a 
copy of the adoption assistance agreement and any amendment or replacement 
therefor, and all other pertinent information. The adoption assistance and 
medical assistance programs of the adoption assistance state shall be notified 
of the identification issuance.</P>
<P>(3) A state which has issued a medical assistance identification pursuant to 
this compact, which identification is valid and currently in force, shall 
accept, process and pay medical assistance claims thereon as on any other 
medical assistance eligibilities of residents.</P>
<P>(4) An adoption assistance state which provides medical services or benefits 
to children covered by its adoption assistance agreements, which services or 
benefits are not provided for those children under the medical assistance 
program of the residence state, may enter into cooperative arrangements with the 
residence state to facilitate the delivery and administration of such services 
and benefits. However, any such arrangements shall not be inconsistent with this 
compact nor shall they relieve the residence state of any obligation to provide 
medical assistance in accordance with its laws and this compact.</P>
<P>(5) A child whose residence is changed from one party state to another party 
state shall be eligible for medical assistance under the medical assistance 
program of the new state of residence.</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE VI. JOINDER AND WITHDRAWAL</P>
<P>(1) This compact shall be open to joinder by any state. It shall enter into 
force as to a state when its duly constituted and empowered authority has 
executed it.</P>
<P>(2) In order that the provisions of this compact may be accessible to and 
known by the general public and so that its status as law in each of the party 
states may be fully implemented, the full text of the compact, together with a 
notice of its execution, shall be caused to be published by the authority which 
has executed it in each party state. Copies of the compact shall be made 
available upon request made of the executing authority in any state.</P>
<P>(3) Withdrawal from this compact shall be by written notice sent by the 
authority which executed it to the appropriate officials of all other party 
states, but no such notice shall take effect until one (1) year after it is 
given in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
<P>(4) All adoption assistance agreements outstanding and to which a party state 
is signatory at the time when its withdrawal from this compact takes effect 
shall continue to have the effects given to them pursuant to this compact, until 
they expire or are terminated in accordance with their provisions. Until such 
expiration or termination, all beneficiaries of the agreements involved shall 
continue to have all rights and obligations conferred or imposed by this compact 
and the withdrawing state shall continue to administer the compact to the extent 
necessary to accord and implement fully the rights and protections preserved 
thereby.</P>
