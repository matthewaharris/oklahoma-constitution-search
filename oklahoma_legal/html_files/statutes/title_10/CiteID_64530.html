<P>A. 1. Except as otherwise provided by the Oklahoma Adoption Code, before 
placing a minor for adoption, the Department of Human Services or a 
child-placing agency shall compile a written medical and social history report 
of the minor to be adopted, containing:</P>
<P>a. all of the information required in subsections B and C of this section 
that is reasonably available from each biological parent, from any person who 
has had legal or physical custody of the minor, and from any other relative, or 
other person or entity who can provide information that cannot otherwise 
reasonably be obtained from the biological parents or a person who has had legal 
or physical custody of the minor,</P>
<P>b. a copy of all medical, dental and psychological records of the minor 
obtained from anyone who has provided medical, dental or psychological services 
to the minor, and</P>
<P>c. a copy of all educational records of the minor.</P>
<P>2. If a minor is not being placed for adoption through the Department or a 
child-placing agency, the attorney representing the adoptive parent in the 
adoption proceedings shall compile the report. If the adoptive parent is not 
represented by an attorney in a direct placement adoption, the person placing 
the minor for adoption shall compile the report.</P>
<P>B. 1. The Department shall prescribe the form to be used to record the 
medical history of the minor and the minor's biological relatives. The 
Department shall furnish the forms to any child-placing agency and to any person 
who is authorized to place a minor for adoption or who provides services with 
respect to placements for adoption.</P>
<P>2. The medical history form shall include, but is not limited to:</P>

<P>(7) any other information necessary to determine the child's eligibility for 
state or federal benefits, including subsidies for adoption and other financial, 
medical, or similar assistance, and</P>
<P>b. relevant information concerning the medical and psychological history of 
the minor's biological parents and relatives, including information 
concerning:</P>
<P>(1) the gynecologic and obstetric history of the biological mother,</P>
<P>(2) the health of the biological mother during her pregnancy with the 
minor,</P>

<P>(4) the exposure of the biological mother to toxic substances, fumes or 
occupational hazards during her pregnancy that could affect the health of the 
minor,</P>

to each other and to what degree,</P>
<P>(6) any history of venereal disease afflicting either biological parent,</P>
<P>(7) physical characteristics of the biological parents, other children of 
either biological parent, and the biological grandparents, including age at the 
time of the minor's birth, height, weight, color of eyes, hair, skin and other 
information of a similar nature,</P>
<P>(8) unusual physical characteristics of any biological parent, other children 
of either biological parent, biological grandparents and other biological 
relatives,</P>
<P>(9) potentially inheritable genetic, psychological, or physical diseases, 
disorders, traits, or tendencies of the biological parents, other children of 
either biological parent, the biological grandparents or other biological 
relatives,</P>
<P>(10) allergies, diseases, illnesses, and other medical history of biological 
parents, other children of either biological parent, biological grandparents and 
other biological relatives, including but not limited to diabetes, high blood 
pressure, alcoholism, heart disease, cancer, and epilepsy or predisposition 
thereto,</P>
<P>(11) any addiction or predisposition to addiction to drugs or alcohol by the 
biological parents, other children of either biological parent, biological 
grandparents or other biological relatives,</P>
<P>(12) if the death of either biological parent, other children of either 
biological parent, or a biological grandparent has occurred, the fact of the 
death, the age of the decedent at the time of death, and the cause, if 
known,</P>
<P>(13) the psychological history of the biological parents, other children of 
either biological parent, biological grandparents and other biological 
relatives, including any psychiatric or psychological evaluations, the date of 
the evaluation, any diagnoses, and a summary of any psychiatric or psychological 
findings or treatment, and</P>
<P>(14) any other useful or unusual health-related information that the 
biological parents or relatives are willing to provide.</P>
<P>C. The social history report regarding the minor to be adopted, the 
biological parents, other children of either biological parent and other 
biological relatives shall include, but is not limited to:</P>
<P>1. The educational history of the minor including, but not limited to, the 
minor's enrollment and performance in school, the results of educational 
testing, special educational needs of the minor, if any, and the number of years 
of school completed at the time of the adoption;</P>
<P>2. The age of the minor, the biological parents, other children of either 
biological parent, and the biological grandparents at the time of the adoption, 
and the gender of the other children of either biological parent;</P>
<P>3. The circumstances leading to the adoption;</P>
<P>4. The heritage of the minor including, but not limited to, the minor's 
nationality, ethnic background, tribal affiliation, if any, and race;</P>
<P>5. The occupation of the biological parents and the biological grandparents, 
but not specific titles or places of employment;</P>
<P>6. The talents, hobbies and special interests of the minor, the biological 
parents, and the biological grandparents;</P>
<P>7. Nonidentifying information about the extended family of the biological 
parents and biological grandparents;</P>
<P>8. The level of educational and vocational achievement of the minor's 
biological parents and relatives and any noteworthy accomplishments;</P>
<P>9. An account of the minor's past and existing relationship with any 
individual with whom the minor has regularly lived or visited;</P>
<P>10. A criminal conviction, judicial order terminating parental rights, or 
other proceeding in which a biological parent of the minor was alleged to have 
abused, neglected, abandoned or otherwise mistreated the minor to be adopted, a 
sibling of the minor to be adopted, or the other biological parent; and</P>
<P>11. A criminal conviction or delinquency adjudication of the minor.</P>
<P>D. A report prepared pursuant to this section must indicate who prepared the 
report.</P>
<P>E. 1. Whenever it is feasible, biological parents, legal or physical 
custodians of the minor and other biological relatives should be assisted in 
providing information for the medical and social history report by trained 
professionals employed by the Department or the licensed child-placing agency, 
by the attorney for the adoptive parents or by trained professionals employed by 
the attorney for the adoptive parent.</P>
<P>2. The Department or agency, attorney for the adoptive parent, or person who 
prepares the medical and social history report shall advise the biological 
parents, any other persons who submitted information for the report and the 
adoptive parent that additional information about the adopted person, the 
biological parents, and the adopted person's genetic history that becomes 
available may be submitted to the Department, agency, attorney, or person who 
prepared the report or if the location is known to them, to the clerk of the 
court that issues the decree of adoption. Nothing in this section shall require 
that the location of the court in which the adoption action is filed be revealed 
to the biological parents, biological relatives or other persons who submitted 
information for the report, if the location is not otherwise known to them.</P>
<P>F. The court may request that a biological parent, a present or former legal 
or physical custodian of the minor, a biological relative, a school, or a 
medical, dental or psychological care provider for the child supply the 
information or records required by this section.</P>
<P>G. Information contained in a medical and social history report compiled 
pursuant to this section shall not be used as evidence in any criminal 
proceeding against the individual who furnished the information. This is a use 
immunity and not a transactional immunity.</P>
<P>H. 1. If the petitioner for the adoption of a minor is a stepparent of the 
minor and the minor will remain in the custody of one biological parent and the 
stepparent following the adoption, only the medical and social history of the 
parent whose parental rights are sought to be terminated and that parent's 
biological relatives must be compiled in the medical and social history 
report.</P>
<P>2. If the petitioner for the adoption of a minor is related to the child, 
only the medical and social history of the parent who is not related to the 
petitioner and the biological relatives of such parent must be completed in the 
medical and social history report.</P>
