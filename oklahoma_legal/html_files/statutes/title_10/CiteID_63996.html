<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children 
is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally 
joining therein in form substantially as follows:</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE I. Purpose and Policy</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>It is the purpose and policy of the party states to 
cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end 
that:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Each child requiring placement shall receive the 
maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or 
institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a 
necessary and desirable degree and type of care.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a 
child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances 
of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable 
requirements for the protection of the child.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The proper authorities of the state from which 
the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis on 
which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the 
care of children will be promoted.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE II. Definitions</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As used in this compact:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) "Child" means a person who, by reason of 
minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship or similar 
control.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) "Sending agency" means a party state, officer or 
employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee 
thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association, 
charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings, or causes to be sent or 
brought any child to another party state.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) "Receiving state" means the state to which a 
child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public 
authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement with state 
or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or 
persons.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) "Placement" means the arrangement for the care of 
a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or 
institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, 
mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in 
character, and any hospital or other medical facility.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE III. Conditions for 
Placement</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) No sending agency shall send, bring, or cause to 
be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster 
care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall 
comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the 
applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children 
therein.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child 
to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as 
a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the 
appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the 
intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice 
shall contain:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) The name, date and place of birth of the 
child.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) The identity and address or addresses of the 
parents or legal guardian.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) The name and address of the person, agency or 
institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring, or 
place the child.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) A full statement of the reasons for such proposed 
action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is proposed 
to be made.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Any public officer or agency in a receiving state 
which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this article may 
request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency of or 
in the sending agency's state, and shall be entitled to receive therefrom, such 
supporting or additional information as it may deem necessary under the 
circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused 
to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public 
authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, 
to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the 
interests of the child.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IV. Penalty for Illegal 
Placement</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or 
brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this 
compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of 
children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which 
it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be 
punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its 
laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such 
violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or 
revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the 
sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for 
children.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE V. Retention of 
Jurisdiction</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over 
the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, 
supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have 
had if the child had remained in the sending agency's state, until the child is 
adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the 
concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such 
jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the 
child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The 
sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and 
maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained 
herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to 
deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it 
may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the 
receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect 
of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to 
prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the 
receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a 
private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the 
receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and 
maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency 
without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VI. Institutional Care of 
Delinquent Children</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an 
institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such 
placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to 
the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to his being sent to 
such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds 
that:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Equivalent facilities for the child are not 
available in the sending agency's jurisdiction; and</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in 
the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VII. Compact 
Administrator</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this 
compact shall designate an officer who shall be general coordinator of 
activities under this compact in his jurisdiction and who, acting jointly with 
like officers of other party jurisdictions, shall have power to promulgate rules 
and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this 
compact.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VIII. Limitations</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This compact shall not apply to:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The sending or bringing of a child into a 
receiving state by his parent, stepparent, grandparent, adult brother or sister, 
adult uncle or aunt, or his guardian and leaving the child with any such 
relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Any placement, sending or bringing of a child 
into a receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which both 
the state from which the child is sent or brought and the receiving state are 
party, or to any other agreement between said states which has the force of 
law.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IX. Enactment and 
Withdrawal</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This compact shall be open to joinder by any state, 
territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, with the consent of Congress, the Government 
of Canada or any province thereof. It shall become effective with respect to any 
such jurisdiction when such jurisdiction has enacted the same into law. 
Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing 
the same, but shall not take effect until two years after the effective date of 
such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the 
withdrawing state to the Governor of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal 
of a party state shall not affect the rights, duties and obligations under this 
compact of any sending agency therein with respect to a placement made prior to 
the effective date of withdrawal.</FONT> </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE X. Construction and 
Severability</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The provisions of this compact shall be liberally 
construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact 
shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this 
compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of 
the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person 
or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact 
and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance 
shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the 
constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force 
and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the 
state affected as to all severable matters."</FONT> </P><B><I>
