<p>b. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to foster care providers having a contract or contracting with a child-placing agency, the Department of Human Services or the Office of Juvenile Affairs prior to September 1, 1998.

<p>2. a. (1) On and after September 1, 1998, except as otherwise provided in divisions (2) and (4) of this subparagraph, prior to contracting with a foster family home for placement of any child who is in the custody of the Department of Human Services or the Office of Juvenile Affairs, each Department shall complete a foster parent eligibility assessment, pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act, for such foster family applicant.

<p>C. The Department or the Board of Juvenile Affairs shall promulgate rules to identify circumstances when a criminal history records search or foster parent eligibility assessment for an applicant or contractor, or any person over the age of thirteen (13) years residing in a private residence in which a child care facility is located, shall be expanded beyond the records search conducted by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation or as otherwise provided pursuant to this section.</p>

<p>D. Except as otherwise provided by the Oklahoma Children's Code and subsection F of this section, a conviction for a crime shall not be an absolute bar to employment, but shall be considered in relation to specific employment duties and responsibilities.</p>

<p>E. 1. Information received pursuant to this section by an owner, administrator, or responsible entity of a child care facility, shall be maintained in a confidential manner pursuant to applicable state and federal laws.</p>

<p>2.

<p>3. Requirements for confidentiality and recordkeeping with regard to the information shall be the same for the child care facility receiving the information in response to a request as those provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection for the child care facility releasing such information.</p>

<p>4. Information received by any facility certified by the Office of Juvenile Affairs may be released to another facility certified by the Office if an individual is being considered for employment or contract, along with any other relevant information, unless the information is deemed confidential by state or federal law.
