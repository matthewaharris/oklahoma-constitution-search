<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The Department of Human Services 
shall establish a search program whereby the services of a confidential 
intermediary who has been certified through the program may be used by eligible 
persons listed in subsection B of this section to locate an adult biological 
relative listed in subsection B of this section with whom contact has been lost 
through adoption or termination of parental rights proceedings. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Subject to the restrictions of 
subsections C and D of this section, the following persons may request a search 
or be the subject of a search through the confidential intermediary search 
program: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. An adult adopted person; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. An adult person who has a parent whose parental 
rights have been terminated; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The legal parent or guardian of any minor or 
mentally incompetent child of a deceased adopted person; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. An adult descendant of a deceased adopted person; 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The legal parent or guardian of any minor or 
mentally incompetent child of a deceased person whose biological parent's 
parental rights have been terminated; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. An adult descendant of a deceased person whose 
biological parent's parental rights have been terminated; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. A biological parent whose parental rights were 
voluntarily or involuntarily terminated by court order in an adoption, juvenile, 
guardianship, or domestic relations proceeding; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. An adult biological sibling or biological 
grandparent of an adult adopted person or of an adult person who has a parent 
whose parental rights have been terminated; and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. The sibling of a deceased biological parent whose 
parental rights were voluntarily or involuntarily terminated by court order in 
an adoption, juvenile, guardianship, or domestic relations proceeding. 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. A search through the confidential 
intermediary program may not be performed on behalf of: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Anyone who has not previously registered with the 
Mutual Consent Voluntary Registry at least six (6) months prior to submission of 
the application for services through the confidential intermediary search 
program; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. An adult adopted person who has a minor biological 
sibling in the same adoptive family or in an adoptive or foster family or other 
placement whose location is known to the adult adopted person; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. An adult whose biological parent's parental rights 
have been terminated and who has a minor biological sibling in the same family 
or in an adoptive or foster family or other placement whose location is known to 
that adult; or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Anyone who has previously initiated a search for a 
biological parent that refused to share identifying information, communicate, or 
meet, and who initiates a subsequent search for a biological relative of that 
biological parent. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. If a biological relative of an 
adopted person, other than a biological parent, applies to initiate a search or 
is the subject of a search, the administrator of the confidential intermediary 
search program shall ascertain from the State Registrar of Vital Statistics 
whether an affidavit of nondisclosure by a: biological parent of the adopted 
person is on file. If such an affidavit is filed with the State Registrar and 
has not been revoked, the administrator of the search program shall decline to 
initiate a search at the request of or for any biological relative of the parent 
who filed the affidavit of nondisclosure, unless the person initiating the 
search can provide satisfactory proof that the biological parent who filed the 
affidavit of nondisclosure is deceased. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The Department of Human Services 
shall administer, directly or through a contractor, the confidential 
intermediary search program. The Department of Human Services shall adopt rules 
and procedures necessary to implement the search program, including but not 
limited to the qualifications, minimum standards for training and certification, 
and standards of conduct for a confidential intermediary. A person shall not act 
as a confidential intermediary unless the person has completed the training 
required by the Department of Human Services, signed and filed an oath of 
confidentiality with the Department of Human Services, and possesses a 
confidential intermediary certificate issued by the Department of Human 
Services. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. The Department of Human Services 
shall develop an oath of confidentiality, which must be signed under penalty of 
perjury by each prospective confidential intermediary prior to receiving 
certification. In the oath, the intermediary shall affirm that: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The intermediary has completed the requisite 
training for a confidential intermediary as required by the Department of Human 
Services; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The intermediary will not disclose to anyone, 
directly or indirectly, identifying or confidential information in the records 
or otherwise obtained through the intermediary's participation in the search 
program, except under the conditions specified in this section; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The intermediary will conduct a reasonable search 
for an individual being sought and make a discreet and confidential inquiry as 
to whether the individual consents to release of identifying information or 
medical information or to meeting or communicating with the individual 
initiating the search, and will report back to the administrator of the program 
the results of the intermediary's search and inquiry; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If the individual initiating the search and the 
individual being sought consent in writing to meet or to communicate with each 
other, the intermediary will act in accordance with the instructions of the 
administrator of the program to facilitate any meeting or communication between 
them; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The intermediary will not accept any fee or 
compensation for the intermediary's services except as authorized by the 
administrator of the search program and the Oklahoma Statutes; and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. The intermediary recognizes that unauthorized 
release of information is a violation of this section and Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=64532"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>7505-1.1</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this title and may 
subject the intermediary to a fine or imprisonment or both, to civil liability, 
and to loss of certification as a confidential intermediary.</FONT><FONT 
face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. 1. After an eligible person 
described in subsection B of this section has: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. completed an application to initiate a search, 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. provided satisfactory proof of identity to the 
administrator of the program, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. paid the fee established by the Department of 
Human Services for initiating a search, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>the administrator of the search program shall assign 
the search to a confidential intermediary certified by the Department of Human 
Services. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The confidential intermediary shall be permitted 
to inspect: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a all court records relevant to the adoption or 
termination of parental rights proceeding, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. the original certificate of birth, or other sealed 
adoption records, and other relevant records, if any, in the possession of the 
State Registrar of Vital Statistics, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. all relevant records in the possession of the 
Department of Human Services. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The confidential intermediary must present to the 
custodians of such records documentary proof of the intermediary's certification 
and the referral form from the administrator of the search program prior to 
obtaining access to any of these records. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The confidential intermediary may also inspect 
records in the possession of a private adoption agency or a private attorney, 
but only if the private agency or attorney voluntarily agrees to cooperate and 
permits the examination. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The confidential intermediary shall keep 
confidential all information obtained during the course of the investigation, 
except as disclosure is permitted by this section. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. 1. If the confidential intermediary 
is able to locate the subject of the search, the confidential intermediary shall 
make a discreet and confidential inquiry as to whether the person who is the 
subject of the search will consent to share identifying information, 
communicate, or meet with the person who initiated the search. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The inquiry to the person who is the subject of 
the search shall be by personal and confidential contact. The inquiry shall be 
made without disclosing the identifying information about the person who 
initiated the search. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If the person who is the subject of the search is 
willing to share identifying information, communicate, or meet with the person 
who initiated the search, the confidential intermediary shall obtain this 
consent in writing, in a document that is dated and signed by the subject of the 
search. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If the person who is the subject of the search is 
not willing to share identifying information, meet, or communicate with the 
person who initiated the search, the confidential intermediary shall attempt to 
obtain any nonidentifying medical or social history information that has been 
requested by the person who has initiated the search. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. If the confidential intermediary discovers the 
subject of the search is deceased, the confidential intermediary shall include 
this information and, if the deceased subject is a biological parent, shall 
include the identity of the biological parent in the written report.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. 1. Any written consent and 
nonidentifying information obtained by the confidential intermediary, along with 
a written report of the results of the intermediary's search and inquiry, shall 
be transmitted to the administrator of the confidential intermediary program. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If the confidential intermediary is unable to 
locate the subject of the search, the intermediary shall report this to the 
administrator of the program and include in this written report a description of 
the search efforts. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If the confidential intermediary discovers that 
the identity of the biological father was unknown or not revealed by the 
biological mother, the confidential intermediary shall also include this 
information in the written report. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. 1. Upon receipt of the report of the 
confidential intermediary, the administrator of the search program shall contact 
the person who initiated the search. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If the subject of the search agreed to share 
identifying information, communicate, or meet, the administrator shall relay 
this information and obtain the written consent of the person who initiated the 
search before arranging the sharing of identifying information, communication, 
or meeting between them. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Upon receiving the written consent of both the 
initiator and the subject of the search, the administrator may utilize the 
services of the confidential intermediary to facilitate a communication or 
meeting. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If nonidentifying medical or social history 
information was obtained, the administrator shall provide a copy of the 
nonidentifying information to the person who initiated the search. If the 
intermediary was unable to locate the subject of the search or the subject is 
deceased or did not consent to exchange identifying information, communicate, or 
meet, the administrator shall share that information with the initiator of the 
search. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. If the subject of the search is a biological 
parent who is deceased, the administrator shall provide the initiator of the 
search with any identifying information available regarding the deceased 
biological parent, if the initiator of the search consents in writing to receive 
the information. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. If the initiator of a search 
subsequently applies to the court for an order allowing the release of 
identifying information for good cause shown, after the subject of the search 
has refused to share identifying information, communicate, or meet, the 
initiator shall advise the court in such person's motion of the results of the 
search. Upon the request of the court, the administrator of the program shall 
disclose to the court the report of the confidential intermediary regarding the 
results of the search, including any information about why the subject of the 
search objected to disclosure or contact. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>L. Any information obtained by a 
confidential intermediary during the course of such person's investigation shall 
be kept strictly confidential and shall be disclosed and utilized only in the 
manner permitted by this section. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>M. Any person who discloses information 
obtained during the course of a search performed under this section in violation 
of this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined up to Five 
Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or imprisoned for a period of six (6) months or 
both. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>N. Any reports and other information 
collected as a result of a search performed under this section shall be retained 
by the administrator of the search program for twenty-two (22) years following 
the date of the initial application for the search. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face=Arial size=2>O. The Department may charge the person 
who initiates the search for the actual expenses incurred in providing the 
service requested under this section and a reasonable fee for compensation of 
the confidential intermediary and the administration of this program.
