</div>
<FONT face=Arial 
size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>A. The Oklahoma Legislature recognizes that:</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>1. Children who have been abused, who are dependent or neglected, or whose 
parents, for whatever reason, may be unable or unwilling to provide care for 
their children, are best served when they can be cared for by grandparents or 
other suitable relatives instead of placing those children in foster care with 
the State of Oklahoma; and</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>2. While grandparents or other relatives are often willing to provide for the 
care of children who can no longer remain with their parents, there may exist 
financial obstacles to the provision of such care, or there may be a need for 
other services to enable the children to remain with their grandparents or other 
relatives in order to prevent the entry of those children into the foster care 
system.</P>
<P>B. It is the intent of the Oklahoma Legislature in enacting this section 
to:</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>1. Recognize family relationships in which a grandparent or other relative 
within the third degree of relationship to the child is the head of a household 
that includes a child otherwise at risk of foster care placement by the 
Department of Human Services;</P>
<P>2. Enhance family preservation and stability by recognizing that most 
children in placements with grandparents and other relatives within the third 
degree of relationship to the child do not need intensive supervision of the 
placement by the courts or by the Department;</P>
<P>3. Provide additional placement options and incentives that will achieve 
permanency and stability for many children who are otherwise at risk of foster 
care placement by the Department because of abuse, abandonment, or neglect, but 
who may successfully be able to reside in the care of relatives within the third 
degree of relationship to the child; and</P></FONT></FONT><FONT 
size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>4. Reserve the limited casework and supervisory resources of the Department 
and the courts expended to care for children in state custody for those cases in 
which children do not have the option for safe, stable care within their 
immediate family.</P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>C. The Department of Human Services shall establish and operate a relative 
support program pursuant to eligibility guidelines established in this section 
and by rules of the Department promulgated thereto which will divert children 
from the foster care program operated by the Department. The relative support 
program shall provide assistance to relatives within the third degree of 
relationship to a child who are caring for the child on a full-time basis, 
regardless of whether there is a court order granting custody of the child to 
the relative.</P>
<P>D. Grandparents or other such relatives who qualify for and participate in 
the relative support program are not required to be certified as foster parents 
or to meet the foster care requirements but shall be capable of providing a 
physically safe environment and a stable, supportive home for the children under 
their care.</P>
<P>E. Upon request by grandparents or other relatives who are caring for a child 
on a full-time basis, the Department shall complete a needs assessment on such 
grandparents or other relatives to determine the appropriate services and 
support needed by the child and the grandparents or other such relatives.</P>
<P>F. Within available funding specified by this section, the relative support 
program may provide grandparents or other suitable relatives with:</P>
<P>1. Case management services;</P>
<P>2. Monthly stipends or other financial assistance, family support and 
preservation services;</P>
<P>3. Flexible funds to enable the grandparents or other relatives to meet 
unusual or crisis expenditures, including but not limited to, making housing 
deposits, utility deposits, or to purchase beds, clothing and food;</P>
<P>4. Subsidized child care and after school care;</P>
<P>5. Respite care;</P>
<P>6. Transportation;</P>
<P>7. Counseling;</P>
<P>8. Support groups;</P>
<P>9. Assistance in accessing parental child support payments;</P>
<P>10. Aid in accessing food stamps, Social Security and other public 
benefits;</P>
<P>11. Information about legal options for relative caregivers;</P>
<P>12. Assistance for establishing a relative guardianship or relative 
custodianship for the child;</P>
<P>13. Available volunteer attorney services;</P>
<P>14. Mediation/family group conferencing; and</P>
<P>15. Community-based services and state or federal programs available to the 
child and relatives to support the child's safety, growth and health 
development.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>G. Children living with grandparents or other relatives within the third 
degree of relationship to the child who are receiving assistance pursuant to 
this section shall be eligible for Medicaid coverage.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>H. Subject to availability of funding, and as may be permitted by federal law 
or regulations governing the Department of Human Services' block grant for 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Department is specifically 
authorized to provide funding assistance from such block grant or other 
available funds for the development and operation of the relative support 
program by providing available funds which are not otherwise committed to or 
necessary for the provision of the Statewide Temporary Assistance Responsibility 
System. In addition, the Department may use any other state, federal or private 
funds available to the Department for such purposes to implement the provisions 
of this section.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>I. 1. In order to qualify for the receipt of any monthly stipend, the 
grandparent or other relative shall meet any eligibility criteria determined by 
the Department of Human Services.</P>
<P>2. Within limits of available funding, monthly stipends may be paid to 
grandparents or other relatives with the third degree of relationship to the 
child who have physical full-time custody of a child who would be unable to 
serve in that capacity without a monthly stipend because of inadequate financial 
resources, thus exposing the child to the trauma of potential placement in a 
shelter or in foster care placement by the Department of Human Services. The 
statewide average monthly rate for children in the legal custody of grandparents 
or other relatives who are not certified as foster homes shall not exceed the 
cost of providing foster care.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>J. Additional assistance may be made available to qualified grandparents or 
other relatives within the third degree of relationship and children, based upon 
specific needs of the grandparent or other relative of the child and the 
specific needs of the child. Such assistance shall also be subject to available 
funding.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>K. The relative support program established by the Department pursuant to 
this section may receive referrals from district courts of this state, from 
social service or child advocate agencies, from any other agency of this state, 
or other states or federal programs. In addition, the relative support program 
may be accessed directly by the grandparents or other relatives of the affected 
children by application made to the Department of Human 
Services.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>L. The Department of Human Services may provide any services necessary to 
effectuate the purposes of this section by contract with any person or with any 
public or private entity.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>M. The provisions of this section shall also be available to a legal guardian 
of a child who is within the fifth degree of relation to the 
child.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>N. The Department of Human Services shall, pursuant to the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedures Act, promulgate any rules necessary to implement the 
provisions of this section.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>O. As a part of the relative support program, the Department shall develop, 
publish, and distribute an informational brochure for grandparents and other 
relatives who provide full-time care for children. The information provided 
under the program authorized by this section may include, but is not limited to, 
the following:</P>
<P>1. The benefits available to children and grandparents or other relatives 
pursuant to this section providing full-time care;</P>
<P>2. The procedures to access the relative support program;</P>
<P>3. A list of support groups and resources located throughout the state;</P>
<P>4. Such other information deemed necessary by the Department; and</P>
<P>5. The brochure may be distributed through municipal and district courts, 
hospitals, public health nurses, child protective services, medical professional 
offices, county health departments, elementary and secondary schools, senior 
citizens centers, public libraries, local, city, county and state offices and 
community action agencies selected by the Department.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>P. The Department of Human Services shall submit a report of the outcomes 
associated with the relative support program established pursuant to this 
section to the Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the 
President Pro Tempore of the State Senate on or before January 15, 
2002.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT><B><I>
