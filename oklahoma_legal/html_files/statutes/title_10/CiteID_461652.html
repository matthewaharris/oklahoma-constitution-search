shall apply to:</P>
<P>1. The interstate placement of a child subject to ongoing court jurisdiction 
in the sending state, due to allegations or findings that the child has been 
abused, neglected, or deprived as defined by the laws of the sending state; 
provided, however, that the placement of such a child into a residential 
facility shall only require notice of residential placement to the receiving 
state prior to placement;</P>
<P>2. The interstate placement of a child adjudicated delinquent or unmanageable 
based on the laws of the sending state and subject to ongoing court jurisdiction 
of the sending state if:</P>
<P>a. the child is being placed in a residential facility in another member 
state and is not covered under another compact, or</P>
<P>b. the child is being placed in another member state and the determination of 
safety and suitability of the placement and services required is not provided 
through another compact; and</P>
<P>3. The interstate placement of any child by a public child-placing agency or 
private child-placing agency as defined in this compact as a preliminary step to 
a possible adoption.</P>
<P>B. The provisions of this compact shall not apply to:</P>
<P>1. The interstate placement of a child in a custody proceeding in which a 
public child-placing agency is not a party, provided the placement is not 
intended to effectuate an adoption;</P>
<P>2. The interstate placement of a child with a nonrelative in a receiving 
state by a parent with the legal authority to make such a placement, provided 
the placement is not intended to effectuate an adoption;</P>
<P>3. The interstate placement of a child by one relative with the lawful 
authority to make such a placement directly with a relative in a receiving 
state;</P>
<P>4. The placement of a child, not subject to Article III, subsection A, into a 
residential facility by the child's parent;</P>
<P>5. The placement of a child with a noncustodial parent provided that:</P>
<P>a. the noncustodial parent proves to the satisfaction of a court in the 
sending state a substantial relationship with the child, </P>
<P>b. the court in the sending state makes a written finding that placement with 
the noncustodial parent is in the best interests of the child, and</P>
<P>c. the court in the sending state dismisses its jurisdiction over the childs 
case;</P>
<P>6. A child entering the United States from a foreign country for the purpose 
of adoption or leaving the United States to go to a foreign country for the 
purpose of adoption in that country;</P>
<P>7. Cases in which a U.S. citizen child living overseas with the child's 
family, at least one of whom is in the U.S. Armed Services, and who is stationed 
overseas, is removed and placed in a state; or</P>
<P>8. The sending of a child by a public child-placing agency or a private 
child-placing agency for a visit as defined by the rules of the Interstate 
Commission.</P>
<P>C. For purposes of determining the applicability of this compact to the 
placement of a child with a family in the Armed Services, the public 
child-placing agency or private child-placing agency may choose the state of the 
service members permanent duty station or the service members declared legal 
residence.</P>
<P>D. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prohibit the concurrent 
application of the provisions of this compact with other applicable interstate 
compacts including the Interstate Compact for Juveniles and the Interstate 
Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance. The Interstate Commission may in 
cooperation with other interstate compact commissions having responsibility for 
the interstate movement, placement or transfer of children, promulgate like 
rules to ensure the coordination of services, timely placement of children, and 
the reduction of unnecessary or duplicative administrative or procedural 
requirements.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE IV. JURISDICTION</P>
<P>A. Except as provided in Article IV, subsection G and Article V, subsection 
B, paragraphs 2 and 3 concerning private and independent adoption and in 
interstate placements in which the public child-placing agency is not a party to 
a custody proceeding, the sending state shall retain jurisdiction over a child 
with respect to all matters of custody and disposition of the child which it 
would have had if the child had remained in the sending state. Such jurisdiction 
shall also include the power to order the return of the child to the sending 
state.</P>
<P>B. When an issue of child protection or custody is brought before a court in 
the receiving state, such court shall confer with the court of the sending state 
to determine the most appropriate forum for adjudication.</P>
<P>C. In accordance with its own laws, the court in the sending state shall have 
authority to terminate its jurisdiction if:</P>
<P>1. The child is reunified with the parent in the receiving state who is the 
subject of allegations or findings of abuse or neglect, only with the 
concurrence of the public child-placing agency in the receiving state; </P>
<P>2. The child is adopted; </P>
<P>3. The child reaches the age of majority under the laws of the sending state; 
</P>
<P>4. The child achieves legal independence pursuant to the laws of the sending 
state; </P>
<P>5. A guardianship is created by a court in the receiving state with the 
concurrence of the court in the sending state; </P>
<P>6. An Indian tribe has petitioned for and received jurisdiction from the 
court in the sending state; or</P>
<P>7. The public child-placing agency of the sending state requests termination 
and has obtained the concurrence of the public child-placing agency in the 
receiving state.</P>
<P>D. When a sending state court terminates its jurisdiction, the receiving 
state child-placing agency shall be notified.</P>
<P>E. Nothing in this article shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a 
receiving state court sufficient to deal with an act of truancy, delinquency, 
crime, or behavior involving a child as defined by the laws of the receiving 
state committed by the child in the receiving state which would be a violation 
of its laws.</P>
<P>F. Nothing in this article shall limit the receiving states ability to take 
emergency jurisdiction for the protection of the child.</P>
<P>G. The substantive laws of the state in which an adoption will be finalized 
shall solely govern all issues relating to the adoption of the child and the 
court in which the adoption proceeding is filed shall have subject matter 
jurisdiction regarding all substantive issues relating to the adoption 
except:</P>
<P>1. When the child is a ward of another court that established jurisdiction 
over the child prior to the placement; </P>
<P>2. When the child is in the legal custody of a public agency in the sending 
state; or</P>
<P>3. When a court in the sending state has otherwise appropriately assumed 
jurisdiction over the child, prior to the submission of the request for approval 
of placement.</P>
<P>H. A final decree of adoption shall not be entered in any jurisdiction until 
the placement is authorized as an "approved placement" by the public 
child-placing agency in the receiving state.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE V. PLACEMENT EVALUATION</P>
<P>A. Prior to sending, bringing, or causing a child to be sent or brought into 
a receiving state, the public child-placing agency shall provide a written 
request for assessment to the receiving state.</P>
<P>B. For placements by a private child-placing agency, a child may be sent or 
brought, or caused to be sent or brought, into a receiving state, upon receipt 
and immediate review of the required content in a request for approval of a 
placement in both the sending and receiving state public child-placing agency. 
The required content to accompany a request for approval shall include the 
following:</P>
<P>1. A request for approval identifying the child, birth parent(s), the 
prospective adoptive parent(s), and the supervising agency, signed by the person 
requesting approval; </P>
<P>2. The appropriate consents or relinquishments signed by the birth parents in 
accordance with the laws of the sending state, or where permitted the laws of 
the state where the adoption will be finalized; </P>
<P>3. Certification by a licensed attorney or authorized agent of a private 
adoption agency that the consent or relinquishment is in compliance with the 
applicable laws of the sending state, or where permitted the laws of the state 
where finalization of the adoption will occur; </P>
<P>4. A home study; and</P>
<P>5. An acknowledgment of legal risk signed by the prospective adoptive 
parents.</P>
<P>C. The sending state and the receiving state may request additional 
information or documents prior to finalization of an approved placement, but 
they may not delay travel by the prospective adoptive parents with the child if 
the required content for approval has been submitted, received, and reviewed by 
the public child-placing agency in both the sending state and the receiving 
state.</P>
<P>D. Approval from the public child-placing agency in the receiving state for a 
provisional or approved placement is required as provided for in the rules of 
the Interstate Commission.</P>
<P>E. The procedures for making and the request for an assessment shall contain 
all information and be in such form as provided for in the rules of the 
Interstate Commission.</P>

the Interstate Commission shall adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact.</P>
<P>2. The bylaws and rules of the Interstate Commission shall establish 
conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its

rights or proprietary interests.</P>
<P>B. Meetings.</P><U></U>
<P>1. The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. The 
chairperson may call additional meetings, and upon the request of a simple 
majority of the member states shall call additional meetings.</P>
<P>2. Public notice shall be given by the Interstate Commission of all meetings 
and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules 
or as otherwise provided in the compact. The Interstate Commission and its 
committees may close a meeting, or portion thereof, where it determines by 
two-thirds (2/3) vote that an open meeting would be likely to:</P>
<P>a. relate solely to the Interstate Commissions internal personnel practices 
and procedures,</P>
<P>b. disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal law,</P>
<P>c. disclose financial or commercial information which is privileged, 
proprietary, or confidential in nature,</P>
<P>d. involve accusing a person of a crime, or formally censuring a person,</P>
<P>e. disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would

endanger one or more persons,</P>
<P>f. disclose investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
or</P>
<P>g. specifically relate to the Interstate Commissions participation in a 
civil action or other legal proceeding.</P>
<P>3. For a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed pursuant to this provision, 
the Interstate Commissions legal counsel or designee shall certify that the 
meeting may be closed and shall reference each relevant exemption provision. The 
Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe 
all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary 
of actions taken and the reasons therefor, including a description of the views 
expressed and the record of a roll-call vote. All documents considered in 
connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and 
documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a 
majority vote of the Interstate Commission or by court order.</P>
<P>4. The bylaws may provide for meetings of the Interstate Commission to be 
conducted by telecommunication or other electronic communication.</P>
<P>C. Officers and Staff.</P>
<P>1. The Interstate Commission may, through its executive committee, appoint or 
retain a staff director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for 
such compensation as the Interstate Commission may deem appropriate. The staff 
director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate Commission, but shall not 
have a vote. The staff director may hire and supervise such other staff as may 
be authorized by the Interstate Commission.</P>
<P>2. The Interstate Commission shall elect, from among its members, a 
chairperson and a vice-chairperson of the executive committee and other 
necessary officers, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be 
specified in the bylaws.</P>
<P>D. Qualified Immunity, Defense and Indemnification.</P>
<P>The Interstate Commissions staff director and its employees shall be immune 
from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a 
claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil 
liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, 
error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for 
believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or 
responsibilities; provided, that such person shall not be protected from suit or 
liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by a criminal act or the 
intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.</P>
<P>1. The liability of the Interstate Commissions staff director and employees 
or Interstate Commission representatives, acting within the scope of such 
persons employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within 
such persons state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the 
Constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. 
The Interstate Commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states 
for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be 
construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, 
injury, or liability caused by a criminal act or the intentional or willful and 
wanton misconduct of such person.</P>
<P>2. The Interstate Commission shall defend the staff director and its 
employees and, subject to the approval of the Attorney General or other 
appropriate legal counsel of the member state, shall defend the commissioner of 
a member state in a civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an 
actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of 
Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the 
defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of 
Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the 
actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or 
willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.</P>
<P>3. To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the 
Interstate Commission, the representatives or employees of the Interstate 
Commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, 
including attorney fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of 
an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of 
Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such 
persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of 
Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the 
actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or 
willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.</P>

that the action of the Interstate Commission is not supported by substantial 
evidence in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and 
set it aside.</P>
<P>F. If a majority of the Legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, 
those states may by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used 
to adopt the compact cause that rule to have no further force and effect in any 
member state.</P>
<P>G. The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on

their health, safety and well-being, </P>
<P>b. prevent loss of federal or state funds, or</P>
<P>c. meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule required by 
federal law.</P>
<P>2. An emergency rule shall become effective immediately upon adoption; 
provided, that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be 
retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later 
than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the emergency rule.</P>

in any action in which the validity of a compact provision or rule is the issue 
for which a judicial determination has been sought and shall have standing to 
intervene in any proceedings. Failure to provide service of process to the 
Interstate Commission shall render any judgment, order, or other determination, 
however so captioned or classified, void as to the Interstate Commission, this 
compact, its bylaws or rules of the Interstate Commission.</P>
<P>B. Dispute Resolution.</P>
<P>1. The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member

mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among compacting states. 
The costs of such mediation or dispute resolution shall be the responsibility of 
the parties to the dispute.</P>

state legal action in the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal 
district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce 
compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws, or rules. The relief 
sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial 
enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the 
litigation including reasonable attorney fees; or</P>

<P>A. The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the 
reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing 
activities.</P>
<P>B. The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment 
from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the 
Interstate Commission and its staff which shall be in a total amount sufficient 
to cover the Interstate Commissions annual budget as approved by its members 
each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon 
a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission which shall promulgate a 
rule binding upon all member states.</P>
