<P>1. The first Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) of the levy 
collected each month shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of 
the State Transportation Fund;</P>
<P>2. One and six hundred twenty-five one-thousandths percent (1.625%) of the 
levy shall be remitted to the State Treasurer to the credit of the High Priority 
State Bridge Revolving Fund as created in Section 506 of Title 69 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes;</P>
<P>3. Sixty-three and seventy-five one-hundredths percent (63.75%) of the levy 
shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the State 
Transportation Fund to be apportioned as follows:</P>
<P>a. the first Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($850,000.00) collected 
each fiscal year shall be transferred to the Public Transit Revolving Fund, 
created in Section 4031 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma Statutes, and</P>
<P>b. the second Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($850,000.00) collected 
each fiscal year shall be transferred to the Oklahoma Tourism and Passenger Rail 
Revolving Fund and shall be used by the Department of Transportation:</P>
<P>(1) to contract railroad passenger services, including but not limited to a 
route linking stations in Oklahoma and Tulsa Counties with other primary points 
in the national railroad passenger system and passenger rail service within the 
state, and a route beginning at a station in Oklahoma County and extending north 
to the Kansas state line in Kay County, and</P>
<P>(2) to provide necessary facility, signaling, and track improvements for 
those contracted services,</P>
<P>c. forty-one and two-tenths percent (41.2%) of the monies apportioned to the

<P>e. any remaining amount of the apportionment shall be deposited into the 
State Transportation Fund;</P>
<P>4. Twenty-seven percent (27%) of the levy shall be transmitted by the Tax 
Commission to the various counties of the state, to be apportioned and used as 
follows:</P>
<P>a. sixty-five and three-tenths percent (65.3%) of the monies apportioned 
under this paragraph shall be used on the following basis:</P>
<P>(1) forty percent (40%) of such sum shall be distributed to the various 
counties in the proportion which the county road mileage of each county bears to 
the entire state road mileage as certified by the Transportation Commission, 
and</P>
<P>(2) the remaining sixty percent (60%) of such sum shall be distributed to the 
various counties on the basis which the population and area of each county bears 
to the total population and area of the state. The population shall be as shown 
by the last Federal Decennial Census or the most recent annual estimate provided 
by the U.S. Bureau of the Census,</P>
<P>b. twenty-three and one-tenth percent (23.1%) of the monies apportioned under 
this paragraph shall be distributed to the counties in the following manner:</P>
<P>One-third (1/3) on area; one-third (1/3) on rural population, defined as 
including the population of all municipalities with a population of less than 
five thousand (5,000) according to the latest Federal Decennial Census; and 
one-third (1/3) on county road mileage, as last certified by the Department of 
Transportation, as each county bears to the entire area, rural population and 
road mileage of the state, and</P>
<P>c. eleven and six-tenths percent (11.6%) of the monies apportioned under this 
paragraph shall be distributed to the various counties of the state based on a 
formula developed by the Department of Transportation and approved by the 
Department of Transportation County Advisory Board created pursuant to Section 
302.1 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The formula shall be similar to the 
formula currently used for the distribution of monies in the County Bridge 
Program funds, but shall also take into consideration the effect of the terrain 
and traffic volume as related to county road improvement and maintenance 
costs;</P>
<P>5. Three and one hundred twenty-five one-thousandths percent (3.125%) of the 
levy shall be distributed to the various counties of the state based on a 
formula developed by the Department of Transportation and approved by the 
Department of Transportation County Advisory Board created pursuant to Section

formula currently used for the distribution of monies in the County Bridge 
Program funds, but shall also take into consideration the effect of the terrain 
and traffic volume as related to county road improvement and maintenance 
costs;</P>
<P>6. Two and two hundred ninety-seven one-thousandths percent (2.297%) of the 
levy shall be distributed to the various counties of the state for deposit into 
the County Bridge and Road Improvement Fund of each county based on a formula 
developed by the Department of Transportation and approved by the Department of 
Transportation County Advisory Board created pursuant to Section 302.1 of Title 
69 of the Oklahoma Statutes to be used for the purposes set forth in the County 
Bridge and Road Improvement Act. The formula shall be similar to the formula 
currently used for the distribution of monies in the County Bridge Program 
funds, but shall also take into consideration the effect of the terrain and 
traffic volume as related to county road improvement and maintenance costs;</P>
<P>7. One and eight hundred seventy-five one-thousandths percent (1.875%) of the 
levy shall be transmitted by the Tax Commission to the treasurers of the various 
incorporated cities and towns of the state in the percentage which the 
population, as shown by the last Federal Decennial Census or the most recent 
annual estimate provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, bears to the total 
population of all the incorporated cities and towns in this state. The funds 
shall be expended for the construction, repair and maintenance of the streets 
and alleys of the incorporated cities and towns of this state; and</P>
<P>8. Three hundred twenty-eight one-thousandths percent (0.328%) of the levy 
shall be transmitted by the Tax Commission to the Statewide Circuit Engineering 
District Revolving Fund as created in Section 687.2 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</P>
<P>B. 1. The funds apportioned or transmitted pursuant to subparagraphs a, b, 
and c of paragraph 4 of subsection A of this section, subsection B of Section 
500.7 of this title, subsection B of Section 704 of this title, Section 706 of 
this title, and paragraph 2 of subsection D of Section 707.3 of this title shall 
be sent to the respective county treasurers and deposited in the county highway 
fund to be used by the county commissioners for the purpose of constructing and 
maintaining county highways and bridges.</P>
<P>2. The funds received by any county shall not be diverted to any other county 
of the state, and shall only be expended under the direction and control of the 
board of county commissioners in the county to which the funds are appropriated. 
If any part of the funds is diverted for any other purpose, the county 
commissioners shall be liable on their bond for double the amount of the money 
so diverted. This paragraph shall not prohibit counties from entering into 
cooperative agreements pertaining to the maintenance and construction of roads 
and bridges.</P>
<P>3. Where any county highway has been laid out over a road already constructed 
in any county by the use of money raised from county bond issues for that 
purpose, either alone or by the use of federal or state aid, or both, the county 
commissioners may set aside out of the funds apportioned to that county, as 
provided in this section, an amount of money equal to the value of any part 
thereof, of the interest of such county in such highway or bridge, which amount 
of money shall be considered by the excise board in reducing the levy for the 
purpose of retiring the bonded indebtedness and interest thereon of the county, 
and shall be used for investment or deposit in the same manner as provided by 
law for the disposition of other sinking fund money.</P>
<P>4. In all counties where the county excise board may find it necessary, 
because of insufficient revenue, to maintain county government out of the 
general fund, after a levy of ten (10) mills has been made for any fiscal year, 
the county excise board may appropriate out of any such funds apportioned to the 
county an amount sufficient to pay the salaries of the county commissioners of 
the county for the fiscal year.</P>
<P>5. Counties may use funds deposited in the county highway fund for the 
purpose of matching federal or state funds, provided such funds are available, 
as necessary to secure assistance in the construction or improvement of the 
county road system.</P>
<P>C. With regards to the apportionment of the levy as set forth in paragraph 5 
of subsection A of this section, paragraph 5 of subsection A of Section 500.7 of 
this title, and subsection C of Section 707.2 of this title:</P>
<P>1. If any county has an accrued balance of funds which were appropriated to 
or otherwise accrued in a restricted road maintenance fund, such funds shall be 
deposited directly to the county highway fund of the county;</P>
<P>2. If any county has an accrued balance of funds which were appropriated to 
or otherwise accrued in the County Road Improvement Fund, or the County Bridge 
Improvement Fund, such funds shall, by resolution approved by a majority of the 
board of county commissioners and filed with the Department of Transportation, 
be deposited in the county highway fund of the county;</P>
<P>3. If any county has an accrued balance of funds which were appropriated to 
or otherwise accrued in the County Bridge and Road Improvement Fund, ninety-nine 
percent (99%) of such funds shall be remitted to the respective county treasurer 
for deposit in the appropriate County Bridge and Road Improvement Fund to be 
used for the purpose set forth in the County Bridge and Road Improvement Act. 
The remaining one percent (1%) of such funds will be remitted to the Statewide 
Circuit Engineering District Revolving Fund; and</P>
<P>4. If any county has an advanced funding agreement with the Department of 
Transportation, the Department of Transportation shall notify the Tax Commission 
as to the amount the county is obligated to pay according to the terms of the 
advanced funding agreement. The obligated amount shall be transferred each month 
by the Tax Commission to the Department of Transportation to the credit of the 
County Bridge and Road Improvement Fund from the funds apportioned to the county 
pursuant to paragraph 5 of subsection A of this section. A county may elect to 
increase the monthly amount to be repaid pursuant to the advanced funding 
agreement from the funds apportioned to the county, but a county shall not be 
permitted to reduce the amount agreed to pursuant to the advanced funding 
agreement.</P>
<P>D. The tax levied on gasoline pursuant to Section 500.4A of this title, and 
the penalties and interest thereon, collected by the Tax Commission under the 
levy shall be apportioned and distributed on a monthly basis to the State 
Highway Construction and Maintenance Fund for the purposes authorized by Section 
1502 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
