<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The tax provided for in Section 1001 et seq. of 
this title shall be paid to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.</P>
<P>B. Except as otherwise provided in subsection G of this section, every person 
responsible for paying or remitting the tax levied by Section 1001 et seq. of 
this title on the production from any lease shall file with the Tax Commission a 
monthly report on each lease, under oath, on forms prescribed by the Tax 
Commission, giving, with other information required, the following:</P>
<P>1. The Tax Commission assigned production unit number, subnumber and merge 
number, or, with the consent of the Tax Commission, the full description of the 
property by lease name, subdivision of quarter section, section, township, and 
range, from which the oil or gas was produced, or both, as may be required by 
the Tax Commission;</P>
<P>2. The Tax Commission assigned company reporting numbers of the producer and 
purchaser, or with the consent of the Tax Commission, the company name;</P>
<P>3. The gross amount of asphalt, ores bearing lead, zinc, jack or copper, oil 
or gas produced or purchased;</P>
<P>4. The kind of mineral, oil, gas, or casinghead gas produced or 
purchased;</P>
<P>5. The total value of the mineral oil, gas, or casinghead gas, at the time 
and place of production, including any and all premiums paid for the sale 
thereof, at the price paid, if purchased at the time of production;</P>
<P>6. If requested by the Tax Commission, the prevailing market price of oil not 
sold at the time of production; and</P>
<P>7. The amount of royalty payable on the production from the lease, if the 
royalty is claimed to be exempt from taxation by law, and the facts on which 
such claim of exemption is based and such other information pertaining to the 
claim as the Tax Commission may require.</P>
<P>Each report required by the provisions of this section shall be filed on 
separate forms as to product and county.</P>
<P>C. No person shall engage in the mining or production within this state of 
asphalt, ores bearing lead, zinc, jack or copper, oil or gas, prior to obtaining 
from the Tax Commission a Tax Commission assigned producer reporting number and 
a Tax Commission assigned production unit number, subnumber and merge number for 
each producing lease. No person shall engage in the purchase of asphalt, ores 
bearing lead, zinc, jack or copper, oil or gas from a producing lease prior to 
obtaining from the Tax Commission a Tax Commission assigned purchaser reporting 
number and the Tax Commission assigned production unit number, subnumber and 
merge number, of the lease from which the production is to be purchased.</P>
<P>1. Every producer and purchaser shall make application, upon forms prescribed 
by the Tax Commission, for a Tax Commission assigned producer or purchaser 
reporting number prior to producing or purchasing production. Every producer 
shall obtain, by making application upon forms prescribed by the Tax Commission, 
a Tax Commission assigned production unit number, subnumber and merge number for 
each lease from which lease production will be sold or disposed before disposing 
of production from any lease in the state.</P>
<P>Provided, however, the Tax Commission shall not approve any application for a 
Tax Commission assigned producer or purchaser reporting number without proper 
confirmation that the applicant has posted the requisite surety documents with 
the Corporation Commission pursuant to Section 318.1 of Title 52 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</P>
<P>2. Every producer or purchaser shall notify the Tax Commission within thirty 
(30) days of any changes of any producing lease in the state as may be required 
by the Tax Commission. Provided, the Tax Commission may relieve producers and 
purchasers of their duty to file the notification required by this paragraph if 
the Tax Commission determines that the notification is not necessary.</P>
<P>3. Gross production tax reports from either the purchaser or producer shall 
become due on the first day of each calendar month on all products subject to 
the tax levied by Section 1001 et seq. of this title produced in and saved 
during the preceding monthly period. If such reports are not received by the Tax 
Commission on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second calendar month 
following the month of production, the reports shall become delinquent. Any 
requested or required amended report or any requested information submitted in 
response to written demand for information which is not received by the Tax 
Commission on or before thirty (30) days after the mailing of the request or 
demand by the Tax Commission or any of its employees shall be delinquent.</P>
<P>D. Every person required to file such forms or reports or who has been 
requested to file an amended report to provide information by written demand, or 
who has purchased oil or gas from a lease prior to being authorized by the Tax 
Commission to purchase production from such lease, will be subject to and may be 
assessed the following penalties for each delinquency:</P>
<P>1. Five Dollars ($5.00) per day for each Tax Commission assigned production 
unit number or subnumber or merge number or product code, upon which a form, 
report, amended report, or for which requested information in response to 
written demand is delinquent and for each day from the date a purchaser buys 
production from a lease from which it is not authorized to purchase to the date 
the Tax Commission approves the purchaser to buy from such lease; provided, such 
penalty shall not be assessed for an amount in excess of One Thousand Five 
Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00). The penalties may be waived by the Tax Commission 
or its designee for good cause shown; and</P>
<P>2. If within twelve (12) months after a previous assessment of penalties as 
provided for by this section a subsequent delinquency occurs, penalties may be 
assessed at the rate of Ten Dollars ($10.00) per day for each Tax Commission 
assigned production unit number or subnumber or merge number, or product code; 
provided such penalty shall not be assessed for an amount in excess of One 
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00). The penalty thereon may be waived, in 
whole or in part, by the Tax Commission, for good cause shown.</P>
<P>The penalties prescribed herein shall be in addition to other penalties 
assessable by the Tax Commission pursuant to the laws of this state. The 
penalties prescribed by this section may be collected and shall be apportioned 
to the General Revenue Fund.</P>
<P>E. Gross production tax forms reports, amended reports, or requested 
information in response to written demands which are received by the Tax 
Commission on or after the time fixed for delinquency, but which were mailed 
prior to the time fixed for delinquency, shall be deemed to have been received 
by the Tax Commission before becoming delinquent. Postmark or registry or 
certified receipt showing deposit in the U.S. mails shall be conclusive evidence 
of the date of mailing. Provided all remittances due under such reports or 
amended reports must be received by the Tax Commission on or before the date 
specified by law regardless of when mailed.</P>
<P>F. In the event a person required to remit the tax levied by the provisions 
of Section 1001 et seq. of this title becomes delinquent in reporting or 
remitting the tax, or upon a determination by the Tax Commission that the state 
may lose tax revenues due to the difficulty of collecting same, the Tax 
Commission may require any person required to remit the tax to furnish a 
sufficient cash deposit, bond, or other security in an amount as will protect 
the tax revenues of this state.</P>
<P>G. In lieu of monthly reporting, a royalty owner taking gas in kind for the 
royalty owner's own consumption who is responsible for remitting the tax levied 
by Section 1001 et seq. of this title may file semiannual reports and remit 
taxes due thereunder to the Tax Commission on or before the first day of January 
and July of each year for the preceding six-month period. If not received on or 
before the last day of such month, the report and tax shall be 
delinquent.</P></FONT>
