<p>b. shall include full-time-equivalent employment in this state of employees who are employed by an employment agency or similar entity other than the establishment which has qualified to receive an incentive payment and who are leased or otherwise provided under contract to the qualified establishment, if such job did not exist in this state prior to the date of approval by the Department of the application of the establishment or the job otherwise qualifies as a new direct job following a change-in-control event. The leasing of employees by the establishment or employees provided under contract with an establishment shall constitute an employer-employee relationship between those employees and the establishment. A job shall be deemed to exist in this state prior to approval of an application if the activities and functions for which the particular job exists have been ongoing at any time within six (6) months prior to such approval. With respect to establishments defined in division (10) of subparagraph a of paragraph 1 of this subsection, new direct jobs shall be limited to those jobs directly comprising the corporate headquarters of or directly relating to manufacturing, maintenance, administrative, financial, engineering, surveying, geological or geophysical services performed by the establishment. Under no circumstances shall employment relating to field services be considered new direct jobs;</p>

<p>4. Estimated direct state benefits means the tax revenues projected by the Department to accrue to the state as a result of new direct jobs;</p>

<p>5. Estimated direct state costs means the costs projected by the Department to accrue to the state as a result of new direct jobs. Such costs shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>(2) the term is or is renewable for not less than twenty (20) years, and</p>

<p>(3) the average annual salary, excluding benefits which are not subject to Oklahoma income taxes, for new direct jobs created as a direct result of the awarding of the contract is projected by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce to equal or exceed Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000.00) within three (3) years of the date of the first incentive payment,</p>

<p>c. except as otherwise provided in subparagraph d of this paragraph, in no event shall incentive payments, cumulatively, exceed the estimated net direct state benefits,</p>

<p>d. the net benefit rate shall be five percent (5%) for an establishment locating:</p>

<p>Should a prime contractor provide notice to the Department of its intent not to apply for incentive for a qualified federal contract or fails to qualify under the criteria above, subcontractors in order of tier ranking as determined by the federal contract verifier may assume the role of the prime and apply to become a qualified federal contractor provided the entity meets the same criteria above with the exception that notice of intent to apply with the Department must be provided within sixty (60) days of the primes disqualification or one hundred eighty (180) days of the award of its subcontract, whichever is later; and</p>
