size=2>
<P>A. Except as provided in subsection K of this section, there shall be allowed 
a credit against the tax imposed by <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=92565">Section 2355 of this title</A> for 
direct investments by Oklahoma agricultural producers in Oklahoma producer-owned 
agricultural processing cooperatives, Oklahoma producer-owned agricultural 
processing ventures, or Oklahoma producer-owned agricultural processing 
marketing associations or Oklahoma-owned and -based corporations or partnerships 
created and designed to develop and advance the production, processing, handling 
and marketing of agricultural commodities grown, made or manufactured in 
Oklahoma. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the amount of the credit shall be 
thirty percent (30%) of the amount of the investment by the Oklahoma 
agricultural producer in Oklahoma producer-owned agricultural processing 
cooperatives, ventures, or marketing associations.</P>
<P>B. For calendar year 2006, and all subsequent years, the credit percentage, 
not to exceed thirty percent (30%), shall be adjusted annually so that the total 
estimate of credits does not exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) 
annually. The formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be thirty 
percent (30%) times Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) divided by the credits 
claimed in the preceding year. In no event shall the credit be claimed more than 
once by a taxpayer each taxable year.</P>
<P>C. In the event the total tax credits authorized by this section exceed Two 
Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Oklahoma Tax 
Commission shall permit any excess over Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) but 
shall factor such excess into the percentage adjustment formula for subsequent 
years.</P>
<P>D. The credits authorized by this act may only be claimed for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2006, and ending before January 1, 2010. The 
provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable to any credits earned, but 
not utilized, prior to the effective date of this act.</P>
<P>E. If the credit allowed pursuant to this section exceeds the amount of state 
income taxes due or if there are no state income taxes due on the income of the 
taxpayer, the amount of credit allowed but not used in any taxable year may be 
carried forward as a credit against subsequent income tax liability for a period 
not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which the investment was 
originally made.</P>
<P>F. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall have the authority to prescribe forms 
for purposes of claiming the credit authorized by this section. The Oklahoma Tax 
Commission shall be authorized to conduct an investigation of the relevant facts 
as may be required in order to verify the eligibility of a claimant to receive a 
credit for any applicable income tax year.</P>
<P>G. 1. For any taxable year during which a taxpayer sells or otherwise 
disposes of the ownership interest for which a tax credit has previously been 
allowed to the taxpayer or for which a tax credit will be allowed to the 
taxpayer for the year in which the sale or other disposition of the ownership 
interest is made, the taxpayer shall be required to reduce the cost of the 
ownership interest in the Oklahoma producer-owned agricultural processing 
cooperative, venture, or marketing association, as reported upon the applicable 
income tax return, by the amount of the tax credit which has previously been 
granted or for which the taxpayer is claiming credit if the credit is allowable 
for the year during which the sale or other disposition is made.</P>
<P>2. If a taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of an ownership interest in the 
Oklahoma producer-owned agricultural processing cooperative, venture, or 
marketing association for which the tax credit authorized by this section may be 
taken in a taxable year following the year in which the ownership interest in 
the Oklahoma producer-owned agricultural processing cooperative, venture, or 
marketing association is sold or otherwise disposed of, the credit authorized by 
this section shall be reduced to account for the prior sale or other 
disposition.</P>
<P>H. The tax credit authorized by this section shall not be available or taken 
for any calendar year during which the claimant of the credit received any 
incentive payments pursuant to the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act or the 
Saving Quality Jobs Act.</P>
<P>I. As used in this section:</P>

substantial assets located within the state. For the purpose of this section, 
the definition contained in this paragraph shall not include an Oklahoma-based 
corporation or partnership that engages only in and nothing more than the 
storage, cleaning, and transportation or production of its commodity;</P>
<P>7. "Agricultural commodities" means a farm or ranch product, including but 
not limited to, wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, timber, cattle, hogs, sheep,

occurring on or after July 1, 2010, for which the credit would otherwise be 
allowable. The provisions of this subsection shall cease to be operative on July 
1, 2012. Beginning July 1, 2012, the credit authorized by this section may be 
claimed for any event, transaction, investment, expenditure or other act 
occurring on or after July 1, 2012, according to the provisions of this 
section.</P>
