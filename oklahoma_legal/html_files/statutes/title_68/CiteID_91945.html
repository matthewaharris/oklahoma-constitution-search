<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. Every manufacturer and wholesaler of cigarettes in this state, as a condition of carrying on such business, shall annually secure from the Oklahoma Tax Commission a written license, and shall pay therefor an annual fee of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00). Application for such license, which shall be made upon such forms as prescribed by the Oklahoma Tax Commission, shall include the following:</p>

<p>1. The applicants agreement to the jurisdiction of the Tax Commission and the courts of this state for the purpose of enforcement of the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91938">Section 301</a> et seq. of this title;</p>

<p>2. The applicants agreement to abide by the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91938">Section 301</a> et seq. of this title and the rules promulgated by the Tax Commission with reference thereto;</p>

<p>3. The wholesaler applicants agreement to sell cigarettes only to licensed retailers or Indian tribal entities or licensees of Indian tribal entities; and</p>

<p>4. The manufacturer applicant's agreement to sell cigarettes only to a licensed wholesaler.</p>

<p>This license, which will be for the ensuing year, must at all times be displayed in a conspicuous place so that it can be seen. Persons operating more than one place of business must secure a license for each place of business. "Place of business" shall be construed to include the place where orders are received, or where cigarettes are sold. A "place of business" cannot be a location with a physical residential address. The Tax Commission shall not issue a license for a place of business with a physical residential address. If cigarettes are sold on or from any vehicle, the vehicle shall constitute a place of business and the regular license fee shall be paid with respect thereto. However, if the vehicle is owned or operated by a place of business for which the regular fee is paid, the annual fee for the license with respect to such vehicle shall be only Ten Dollars ($10.00). The expiration for such vehicle license shall expire on the same date as the current license of the place of business.</p>

<p>Provided, that the Tax Commission shall not authorize the use of a stamp-metering device by any manufacturer or wholesaler who does not maintain a warehouse or wholesale establishment or place of business within the State of Oklahoma from which cigarettes are received, stocked and sold and where such metering device is kept and used; but the Tax Commission may, in its discretion, permit the use of such metering device by manufacturers and wholesalers of cigarettes residing wholly within another state where such state permits a licensed Oklahoma resident, manufacturer or wholesaler of cigarettes the use of the metering device of such state without first requiring that such manufacturer or wholesaler establish a place of business in such other state. The provisions of this subsection relating to metering devices shall not apply to states which do not require the affixing of tax stamps to packages of cigarettes before same are offered for sale in such states.</p>

<p>B. Every retailer in this state, except Indian tribal entities or licenses of Indian tribal entities, as a condition of carrying on such business, shall secure from the Tax Commission a license and shall pay therefor a fee of Thirty Dollars ($30.00). Application for such license, which shall be made upon such forms as prescribed by the Tax Commission, shall include the following:</p>

<p>1. The applicants agreement to the jurisdiction of the Tax Commission and the courts of this state for the purpose of enforcement of the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91938">Section 301</a> et seq. of this title;</p>

<p>2. The applicants agreement to abide by the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91938">Section 301</a> et seq. of this title and the rules promulgated by the Tax Commission with reference thereto;</p>

<p>3. The applicants agreement that it shall not purchase any cigarettes for resale from a supplier that does not hold a current wholesalers license issued pursuant to this section; and</p>

<p>4. The applicants agreement to sell cigarettes only to consumers.</p>

<p>Such license, which will be for the ensuing three (3) years, must at all times be displayed in a conspicuous place so that it can be seen. Upon expiration of such license, the retailer to whom such license was issued may obtain a renewal license which shall be valid for three (3) years. The manner and prorated fee for renewals shall be prescribed by the Tax Commission. Every person operating under such license as a retailer and who owns or operates more than one place of business must secure a license for each place of business. "Place of business" shall be construed to include places where orders are received or where cigarettes are sold. A "place of business" cannot be a location with a physical residential address. The Tax Commission shall not issue a license for a place of business with a physical residential address.</p>

<p>C. Every distributing agent shall, as a condition of carrying on such business, pursuant to written application on a form prescribed by and in such detailed form as the Tax Commission may require, annually secure from the Tax Commission a license, and shall pay therefor an annual fee of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). An application shall be filed and a license obtained for each place of business owned or operated by a distributing agent. The license, which will be for the ensuing year, shall be consecutively numbered, nonassignable and nontransferable, and shall authorize the storing and distribution of unstamped cigarettes within this state when such distribution is made upon interstate orders only.</p>

<p>D. 1. All wholesale, retail, and distributing agent's licenses shall be nonassignable and nontransferable from one person to another person. Such licenses may be transferred from one location to another location after an application has been filed with the Tax Commission requesting such transfer and after the approval of the Tax Commission.</p>

<p>2. Wholesale, retail, and distributing agent's licenses shall be applied for on a form prescribed by the Tax Commission. Any person operating as a wholesaler, retailer, or distributing agent must at all times have a valid license which has been issued by the Tax Commission. If any such person or licensee continues to operate as such on a license issued by the Tax Commission which has expired, or operates without ever having obtained from the Tax Commission such license, such person or licensee shall, after becoming delinquent for a period in excess of fifteen (15) days, pay to the Tax Commission, in addition to the annual license fee, a penalty of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per day on each delinquent license for each day so operated in excess of fifteen (15) days. The penalty provided for herein shall not exceed the annual license fee for such license.</p>

<p>E. No license may be granted, maintained or renewed if any of the following conditions applies to the applicant. For purposes of this section, "applicant" includes any combination of persons owning directly or indirectly, in the aggregate, more than ten percent (10%) of the ownership interests in the applicant:</p>

<p>1. The applicant owes Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or more in delinquent cigarette taxes;</p>

<p>2. The applicant had a cigarette manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer or distributor license revoked by the Tax Commission within the past two (2) years;</p>

<p>3. The applicant has been convicted of a crime relating to stolen or counterfeit cigarettes, or receiving stolen or counterfeit cigarettes or has been convicted of or has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any felony;</p>

<p>4. If the applicant is a cigarette manufacturer, the applicant is neither:</p>

<p>a. a participating manufacturer as defined in Section II (jj) of the Master Settlement Agreement as defined in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=104398">Section 600.22 of Title 37</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, nor</p>

<p>b. in full compliance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=437429">Section 600.23 of Title 37</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes;</p>

<p>5. If the applicant is a cigarette manufacturer, if any cigarette imported by such applicant is imported into the United States in violation of 19 U.S.C., Section 1681a; or</p>

<p>6. If the applicant is a cigarette manufacturer, if any cigarette imported or manufactured by the applicant does not fully comply with the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C., Section 1331 et seq.</p>

<p>F. No person or entity licensed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall purchase cigarettes from or sell cigarettes to a person or entity required to obtain a license unless such person or entity has obtained such license.</p>

<p>G. No person licensed as a retailer in this state shall:</p>

<p>1. Sell any cigarettes to any other person licensed as a retailer in this state unless such sale is for the purpose of moving inventory between stores which are part of the same company; or</p>

<p>2. Purchase any cigarettes from any person or entity other than a wholesaler licensed pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91938">Section 301</a> et seq. of this title.</p>

<p>H. In addition to any civil or criminal penalty provided by law, upon a finding that a licensee has violated any provision of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91938">Section 301</a> et seq. of this title, the Tax Commission may revoke or suspend the license or licenses of the licensee pursuant to the procedures applicable to revocation of a license set forth in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91957">Section 316</a> of this title.</p>

<p>I. The Tax Commission shall create and maintain a web site setting forth all current valid licenses and the identity of licensees holding such licenses, and shall update the site no less frequently than once per month.</p>
