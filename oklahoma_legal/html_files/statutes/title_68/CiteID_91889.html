<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. If any taxpayer shall fail to make any report or return as required by any state tax law, the Oklahoma Tax Commission, from any information in its possession or obtainable by it, may determine the correct amount of tax for the taxable period. If a report or return has been filed, the Tax Commission shall examine such report or return and make such audit or investigation as it may deem necessary. If, in cases where no report or return has been filed, the Tax Commission determines that there is a tax due for the taxable period, or if, in cases where a report or return has been filed, the Tax Commission shall determine that the tax disclosed by such report or return is less than the tax disclosed by its examination, it shall in writing propose the assessment of taxes or additional taxes, as the case may be, and shall mail a copy of the proposed assessment to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last-known address. Proposed assessments made in the name of the "Oklahoma Tax Commission" by its authorized agents shall be considered as the action of the Tax Commission.</p>

<p>B. Any assessment, correction or adjustment made as a result of an office audit shall be presumed to be the result of an audit of the report or return only, and such office audit shall not be deemed a verification of any item in the report or return unless the item shall have been made the subject of a hearing before the Tax Commission, and the correctness and amount of such item determined at such hearing; and such office audit shall not preclude the Tax Commission from subsequently making further adjustment, correction or assessment as a result of a field audit of the books and records of the taxpayer, wherever located, or upon disclosures from any source other than the return. In cases where no report or return has been filed, the assessment of the tax on any information available shall in no event preclude the assessment at any time on subsequently disclosed information.</p>

<p>C. Within sixty (60) days after the date indicated on the aforesaid proposed assessment, the taxpayer may file with the Tax Commission a written protest under oath, signed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent, on such a form as the Tax Commission may prescribe, setting out therein:</p>

<p>1. A statement of the amount of deficiency as determined by the Tax Commission, the nature of the tax and the amount thereof in controversy;</p>

<p>2. A clear and concise assignment of each error alleged to have been committed by the Tax Commission;</p>

<p>3. The argument and legal authority upon which each assignment of error is made; provided, that the applicant shall not be bound or restricted in such hearing, or on appeal, to the arguments and legal authorities contained and cited in the application;</p>

<p>4. A statement of relief sought by the taxpayer; and</p>

<p>5. A verification by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent that the statements and facts contained therein are true.</p>

<p>D. If in such written protest the taxpayer shall request an oral hearing, the Tax Commission shall grant such hearing, and shall, by written notice, advise the taxpayer of a date, which shall not be less than ten (10) days from the date of mailing of such written notice, when such taxpayer may appear before the Tax Commission and present arguments and evidence, oral or written, in support of the protest. Hearings shall be held as soon as practicable. In the event an oral hearing is not requested, the Tax Commission shall proceed without further notice to examine into the merits of the protest and enter an order in accordance with its findings. Upon request of any taxpayer and upon proper showing that the principle of law involved in the assessment of any tax is already pending before the courts for judicial determination, the taxpayer, upon agreement to abide by the decision of the court, may pay the tax so assessed under protest and such protest shall be resolved in accordance with the agreement to abide.</p>

<p>E. If the taxpayer fails to file a written protest within the sixty-day period herein provided for or within the period as extended by the Tax Commission, or if the taxpayer fails to file the notice required by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=494046">Section 226</a> of this title within thirty (30) days from the date indicated on the proposed assessment, then the proposed assessment, without further action of the Tax Commission, shall become final and absolute. A taxpayer who fails to file a protest to an assessment of taxes within the time period prescribed by this section may, within one (1) year of the date the assessment becomes final, request the Tax Commission to adjust or abate the assessment if the taxpayer can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the assessment or some portion thereof is clearly erroneous. If the Tax Commission determines that the proper showing has been made, the assessment or portion thereof determined to be clearly erroneous shall be deemed not to have become final and absolute. No hearing to adjust or abate a clearly erroneous assessment may be granted after the Tax Commission's denial of such a request. An order of the Tax Commission denying a taxpayer's request to adjust or abate an assessment alleged to be clearly erroneous is not an appealable order under <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91893">Section 225</a> of this title. No proceeding instituted by the Tax Commission to collect a tax liability may be stayed because of a request made by a taxpayer to adjust or abate an assessment alleged to be clearly erroneous.</p>

<p>F. The Tax Commission may in its discretion extend the time for filing a protest for any period of time not to exceed an additional ninety (90) days. Any extension granted shall not extend the period of time within which the notice required by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=494046">Section 226</a> of this title may be filed.</p>

<p>G. Within a reasonable time after the hearing herein provided for, the Tax Commission shall make and enter an order in writing in which it shall set forth the disposition made of the protest and a copy of such order shall forthwith be mailed to the taxpayer. The order shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. After removing the identity of the taxpayer, the Tax Commission shall make the order available for public inspection and shall publish those orders the Tax Commission deems to be of precedential value. The taxpayer may appeal the order within the time and in the manner provided for by Section 225 of this title, but in the event the taxpayer fails to so proceed, the order shall, within thirty (30) days from the date a certified copy thereof is mailed to the taxpayer, become final. The provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=494046">Section 226</a> of this title shall not apply where a proposed assessment or an assessment of taxes has been permitted to become final.</p>

<p>H. In all instances where the proposed assessment or the assessment of taxes or additional taxes has been permitted to become final, a certified copy of the assessment may be filed in the office of the county clerk of any county in this state, and upon being so filed, the county clerk shall enter same upon the judgment docket in the same manner as provided for in connection with judgments of district courts. When an assessment is so filed and docketed, it shall have the same force and be subject to the same law as a judgment of the district court, and accordingly it shall constitute a lien on any real estate of the taxpayer located in the county wherein filed; and execution may issue and proceedings in aid of execution may be had the same as on judgments of district courts. Such lien is hereby released and extinguished upon the payment of such assessment, or, except as otherwise provided herein, upon the expiration of ten (10) years after the date upon which the assessment was filed in the office of the county clerk; provided, the Tax Commission may, prior to the release and extinguishment of such lien, refile the assessment one time in the office of the county clerk. An assessment so refiled shall continue the lien until payment of the assessment, or upon the expiration of ten (10) years after the date upon which the assessment was refiled in the office of the county clerk. The remedies provided in this subsection shall be in addition to other remedies provided by law. All active liens evidenced by an assessment filed with a county clerk's office prior to November 1, 1989, shall be released and extinguished if the assessment is not refiled prior to November 1, 2001.</p>

<p>I. In order to make more definite the intention of the Legislature in connection with the applicability or lack of applicability of the refund provisions of the tax statutes to those treating with proposed assessments and assessments that have become final, the Legislature being cognizant of the fact that such intent has been questioned, it is declared to be the intent of the Legislature that the refund provisions shall be without application to taxes where the amount thereof has been determined by an assessment, other than an assessment designated as an "office audit", that has become final.</p>

<p>J. Within fifteen (15) days after electronic notification of the denial of a tax credit authorized by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=494417">Section 28-101 of Title 70</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, a taxpayer may file with the Tax Commission a written protest under oath, signed by the taxpayer or the taxpayers duly authorized agent, on such a form as the Tax Commission may prescribe. If the taxpayer fails to file a written protest within the fifteen-day period, then the denial shall become final and absolute.</p>

<p>1. If in such timely written protest the taxpayer shall request an oral hearing, the Tax Commission shall set a date for hearing upon the protest. The Tax Commission shall, by written notice, advise the taxpayer of the time and place of the hearing, which shall not be less than ten (10) days from the date of mailing of such written notice, when such taxpayer may appear before the Tax Commission and present arguments and evidence, oral or written, in support of the protest.</p>

<p>2. Within sixty (60) days after the written protest is filed, the Tax Commission shall make and enter an order in writing in which it shall set forth the disposition made of the protest and a copy of such order shall forthwith be mailed to the taxpayer. The order shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. The taxpayer may appeal the order within the time and in the manner provided for by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=91893">Section 225</a> of this title, but in the event the taxpayer fails to so proceed, the order shall, within thirty (30) days from the date a certified copy thereof is mailed to the taxpayer, become final.</p>
