</div>
<p>A. The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority shall, according to the requirements of the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority Act, issue obligations in a principal amount determined as required by this section upon certification by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce that an establishment has filed the second irrevocable election described in subsection A of Section&nbsp;3658 of this title. The Authority shall not issue any additional obligations as a result of a second irrevocable election authorized by Section 3658 of this title until any obligations issued by the Authority prior to the effective date of this act have been fully defeased. No obligation issued by the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority pursuant to this act shall be considered a general obligation of the State of Oklahoma for any purpose and the indebtedness incurred shall be a debt of the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority and not a debt of the State of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the total principal amount of indebtedness incurred by the Authority shall not be greater than an amount required for proceeds equal to fourteen and four-tenths percent (14.4%) of the maximum amount of projected additional investment, as disclosed pursuant to Section&nbsp;3655 of this title, for the applicable facility of an establishment as defined by Section 3653 of this title. The maximum amount of projected additional investment for purposes of this&nbsp;subsection shall not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000.00).</p>

<p>C. The proceeds of such issuance shall be used by the Authority for the benefit of an establishment making a second irrevocable election pursuant to the requirements of this act and such proceeds shall be made available to an establishment for purposes of making the investments described by Section 3653 and Section 3655 of this title according to the requirements of this act and any agreement executed by the establishment and the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority.</p>

<p>D. Upon receipt and analysis of the disclosures regarding proposed investment for additional modernization and retooling of a facility located within the state and owned by an establishment that qualifies for access to the proceeds from the sale of the obligations, the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority shall, if requested by the establishment, structure the issuance of the obligations in a manner that provides for the receipt of proceeds equal to fourteen and four-tenths percent (14.4%) of the amount of additional investment disclosed pursuant to the provisions of Section 3655 of this title.</p>

<p>E. Upon availability of such proceeds, the Authority shall make payment to the qualified establishment of the full allocation of proceeds from a second or subsequent issuance of obligations based upon the computation required by subsection D of this section.</p>

<p>F. The obligations authorized by subsection A of this section, whether issued prior to or on or after the effective date of this act, shall be fully repaid in a period not to exceed twenty (20) years from their issuance.</p>

<p>G. The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority shall require that each and every establishment filing a second irrevocable election pursuant to Section&nbsp;3658 of this&nbsp;title will use proceeds derived from the sale of obligations issued pursuant to subsection A of this section according to the requirements of this act.</p>

<p>H. An establishment that otherwise qualifies to use proceeds from the sale of obligations pursuant to this section shall be required to provide documentation to the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority that, prior to the effective date of this act, a minimum of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) has been expended or legally committed for expenditure for a modernization and retooling of an existing facility located within the state before the Authority is authorized to transfer any such proceeds to the establishment.</p>

<p>I. Subject to the requirements of this section, the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority is authorized to issue its obligations in the principal amount required in order to make the proceeds from the sale of its obligations available to each establishment that qualifies for the use of such proceeds as required by this section, and in such additional principal amount as may be required for the payment of interest or the payment of principal and interest for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, or subsequent fiscal year, together with such additional principal amount that may be required or that may be associated with the costs of the issuance of the obligations. Under no circumstances shall the amount of proceeds derived from the sale of obligations authorized by subsection A of this section and which are made available to a qualified establishment exceed the amount prescribed by this section.</p>

<p>J. The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority shall provide that the first payment of interest or the first payment of principal and interest in repayment of the obligations authorized by subsection A of this section as a result of a second irrevocable election shall not become due until the later of July 1, 2009, or the first date upon which the revenues payable to the Authority from the Quality Jobs Program Incentive Leverage Fund are no longer committed to the payment of debt service requirements and related costs in connection with obligations issued by the Authority pursuant to the Quality Jobs Program Incentive Leverage Act prior to the effective date of this act, if feasible, or the Authority shall provide for the first payment of interest or the first payment of principal and interest using some portion of the proceeds derived from the sale of obligations authorized by subsection A of this section. If any payment of principal or interest with respect to obligations issued on or after the effective date of this act is due at any time after July 1, 2009, the Authority may use such proceeds with respect to such required payment.&nbsp;With respect to obligations issued by the Authority as a result of a second irrevocable election, in no case shall the Authority issue the obligations in any manner that requires the use of revenues apportioned to the Quality Jobs Program Incentive Leverage Fund pursuant to Section 3659 of this act until July 1,&nbsp;2009, or thereafter.</p>

<p>K. The Oklahoma Development Finance authority may enter into such agreements with a qualified establishment as are necessary to implement the provisions of this act. The Authority shall require that an establishment using proceeds from obligations issued pursuant to this section as a result of a second irrevocable election enter into a contract with the Authority reflecting the benefits derived by the State of Oklahoma in a manner consistent with the findings of Section 3652 of this title. The Authority may provide for the issuance of obligations in a manner that results in availability of proceeds suitable to the proposed additional investment activity of an establishment and which takes into account the obligation of the Authority to repay principal and interest with the objective of obtaining the most favorable financing terms to the Authority for the repayment of the obligations.</p>

<p>L. If an establishment to which proceeds from the sale of obligations issued pursuant to subsection A of this section as a result of a second irrevocable election are transferred does not make use of the proceeds in the amount required by any agreement with the Authority or in contravention of any of the terms or requirements imposed by the Authority or by the requirements of this act, the establishment shall become liable to the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority for the payment of principal, interest or other costs associated with the repayment of any amount of debt represented by obligations issued pursuant to subsection A of this section resulting from a second irrevocable election to the extent such proceeds were paid to the establishment and such proceeds were not used in the amount disclosed to the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority pursuant to Section 3655 of this title. If an establishment does not make the full amount of additional investment as disclosed pursuant to Section 3655 of this title, the establishment shall be liable for principal, interest or other costs associated with repayment of debt equal to the difference between the amount of investment disclosed pursuant to Section&nbsp;3655 of this&nbsp;title and the actual investment made by the establishment multiplied by fourteen and four-tenths percent (14.4%).</p>

<p>M. An establishment that otherwise qualifies for the use of proceeds derived from the sale of obligations pursuant to subsection A of this section resulting from a second irrevocable election shall execute and deliver to the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority a guaranty, or shall cause a guaranty to be executed and delivered by a third party, in such form as the Authority may determine, for the benefit of the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority in the event of a deficit between the sum of the incentive payment and the withholding taxes transferred to the Quality Jobs Program Incentive Leverage Fund pursuant to Section 3659 of this&nbsp;title and the total amount required for the payment of principal, interest or other costs associated with the obligations, proceeds from the sale of which are paid to the establishment or are available for use by the establishment. The Authority shall only accept a third-party guaranty from an entity that has a net worth in excess of the net worth of the establishment on behalf of which the guaranty is provided. Payments received by the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and pursuant to the terms of the guaranty shall be deposited into the Quality Jobs Program Incentive Leverage Fund. The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority shall require that the guaranty provide for such terms of payment as may be required to make payments of principal, interest or other costs in a timely manner to the entity or entities to which the Authority is obligated to make payment. No revenues authorized to be apportioned pursuant to Section 2352 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be transferred to the Quality Jobs Program Incentive Leverage Fund until the terms of the guaranty have been invoked and payment received or until the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority determines an event of default under the terms of the guaranty.</p>

<p>N. The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority, in addition to any other powers granted to it pursuant to the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority Act, may pursue such remedies for the collection of any debt owed to the Authority as authorized by this section as are available to any creditor under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>O. The provisions of the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority Act shall be fully applicable to the obligations issued pursuant to subsection A of this section and except insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the provisions of the Oklahoma Development Finance Authority Act, the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Incentive Leverage Act shall supercede and govern all entities, transactions, obligations, rights and remedies associated with such obligations.</p>
