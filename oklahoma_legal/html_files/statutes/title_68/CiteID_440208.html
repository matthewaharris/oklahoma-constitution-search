</div>
<p>A. 1. Except as otherwise provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92488">Sections 2101</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92498">2108</a> of this title, there shall be levied an excise tax upon the transfer of legal ownership of any vehicle registered in this state and upon the use of any vehicle registered in this state and upon the use of any vehicle registered for the first time in this state. Except for persons that possess an agricultural exemption pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92360">Section 1358.1</a> of this title, the excise tax shall be levied upon transfers of legal ownership of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively off roads and highways which occur on or after July 1, 2005, and upon transfers of legal ownership of utility vehicles used exclusively off roads and highways which occur on or after July 1, 2008. The excise tax for new and used all-terrain vehicles, utility vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively off roads and highways shall be levied at four and one-half percent (4 1/2%) of the actual sales price of each new and used all-terrain vehicle and motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways before any discounts or credits are given for a trade-in. Provided, the minimum excise tax assessment for such all-terrain vehicles, utility vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively off roads and highways shall be Five Dollars ($5.00). The excise tax for new vehicles shall be levied at three and one-fourth percent (3 1/4%) of the value of each new vehicle. The excise tax for used vehicles shall be as follows:</p>

<p>a. from October 1, 2000, until June 30, 2001, Twenty Dollars ($20.00) on the first One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or less of value of such vehicle, and three and one-fourth percent (3 1/4%) of the remaining value of such vehicle,</p>

<p>b. for the year beginning July 1, 2001, and ending June 30, 2002, Twenty Dollars ($20.00) on the first One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,250.00) or less of value of such vehicle, and three and one-fourth percent (3 1/4%) of the remaining value of such vehicle, and</p>

<p>c. for the year beginning July 1, 2002, and all subsequent years, Twenty Dollars ($20.00) on the first One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) or less of value of such vehicle, and three and one-fourth percent (3 1/4%) of the remaining value of such vehicle.</p>

<p>2. There shall be levied an excise tax of Ten Dollars ($10.00) for any:</p>

<p>a. truck or truck-tractor registered under the provisions of subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440198">Section 1133 of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, for a laden weight or combined laden weight of fifty-five thousand (55,000) pounds or more,</p>

<p>b. trailer or semitrailer registered under subsection C of Section 1133 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes, which is primarily designed to transport cargo over the highways of this state and generally recognized as such, and</p>

<p>c. frac tank, as defined by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=66447">Section 54 of Title 17</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, and registered under subsection C of Section 1133 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>Except for frac tanks, the excise tax levied pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply to special mobilized machinery, trailers, or semitrailers manufactured, modified or remanufactured for the purpose of providing services other than transporting cargo over the highways of this state. The excise tax levied pursuant to this paragraph shall also not apply to pickup trucks, vans, or sport utility vehicles.</p>

<p>3. The tax levied pursuant to this section shall be due at the time of the transfer of legal ownership or first registration in this state of such vehicle; provided, the tax shall not be due at the time of the issuance of a certificate of title for an all-terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle used exclusively off roads and highways which is not required to be registered but which the owner chooses to register pursuant to the provisions of subsection B of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=443642">Section 1115.3 of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, and shall be collected by Service Oklahoma or an appointed licensed operator, at the time of the issuance of a certificate of title for any such vehicle. In the event an excise tax is collected on the transfer of legal ownership or use of the vehicle during any calendar year, then an additional excise tax must be collected upon all subsequent transfers of legal ownership. In computing the motor vehicle excise tax, the amount collected shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. The excise tax levied by this section shall be delinquent from and after the thirtieth day after the legal ownership or possession of any vehicle is obtained. Any person failing or refusing to pay the tax as herein provided on or before date of delinquency shall pay in addition to the tax a penalty of One Dollar ($1.00) per day for each day of delinquency, but such penalty shall in no event exceed the amount of the tax. Of each dollar penalty collected pursuant to this subsection:</p>

<p>a. fifty cents ($0.50) shall be apportioned as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92284">Section 1104</a> of this title, and</p>

<p>b. fifty cents ($0.50) shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2011, and for all subsequent fiscal years, shall be deposited in the State Highway Construction and Maintenance Fund.</p>

<p>B. The excise tax levied in subsection A of this section and assessed on all commercial vehicles registered pursuant to Section 1120 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes and trailers and semitrailers registered under subsection C of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440198">Section 1133 of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes to transport cargo over the highways of this state shall be in lieu of all sales and use taxes levied pursuant to the Sales Tax Code or the Use Tax Code. The transfer of legal ownership of any motor vehicle as used in this section and the Sales Tax Code and the Use Tax Code shall include the lease, lease purchase or lease finance agreement involving any truck in excess of eight thousand (8,000) pounds combined laden weight or any truck-tractor provided the vehicle is registered in Oklahoma pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440194">Section 1120 of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes or any frac tank, trailer, semitrailer or open commercial vehicle registered pursuant to Section 1133 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The excise tax levied pursuant to this section shall not be subsequently collected at the end of the lease period if the lessee acquires complete legal title of the vehicle.</p>

<p>C. The provisions of this section shall not apply to transfers made without consideration between:</p>

<p>1. Husband and wife;</p>

<p>2. Parent and child; or</p>

<p>3. An individual and an express trust which that individual or the spouse, child or parent of that individual has a right to revoke.</p>

<p>D. 1. There shall be a credit allowed with respect to the excise tax paid for a new vehicle which is a replacement for:</p>

<p>a. a new original vehicle which is stolen from the purchaser/registrant within ninety (90) days of the date of purchase of the original vehicle as certified by a police report or other documentation as required by Service Oklahoma, or</p>

<p>b. a defective new original vehicle returned by the purchaser/registrant to the seller within six (6) months of the date of purchase of the defective new original vehicle as certified by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>2. The credit allowed pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be in the amount of the excise tax which was paid for the new original vehicle and shall be applied to the excise tax due on the replacement vehicle. In no event shall the credit be refunded.</p>

<p>E. Despite any other definitions of the terms "new vehicle" and "used vehicle", to the contrary, contained in any other law, the term "new vehicle" as used in this section shall also include any vehicle of the latest manufactured model which is owned or acquired by a licensed used motor vehicle dealer which has not previously been registered in this state and upon which the motor vehicle excise tax as set forth in this section has not been paid. However, upon the sale or transfer by a licensed used motor vehicle dealer located in this state of any such vehicle which is the latest manufactured model, the vehicle shall be considered a used vehicle for purposes of determining excise tax.</p>

<p>F. The provisions of this section shall not apply to state government entities.</p>
