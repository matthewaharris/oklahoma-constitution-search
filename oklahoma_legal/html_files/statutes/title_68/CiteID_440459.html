<P>A. An establishment which meets the qualifications specified in the Small Employer Quality Jobs Incentive Act may receive quarterly incentive payments for a seven-year period from the Oklahoma Tax Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Small Employer Quality Jobs Incentive Act in an amount equal to the net benefit rate multiplied by the actual gross taxable payroll of new direct jobs as verified by the Tax Commission.</P>
<P>B. In order to receive incentive payments, an establishment shall apply to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the Department and shall contain such information as may be required by the Department to determine if the applicant is qualified.

<P>a. those establishments in the NAICS Manual under the U.S. Industry No. 541710 or 541380 are excused from the out-of-state sales requirement,</P>

The Tax Commission may require the qualified establishment to submit additional information as may be necessary to administer the provisions of the Small Employer Quality Jobs Incentive Act. The approved establishment shall report to the Tax Commission quarterly to show its continued eligibility for incentive payments, as provided in <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=93264">Section&nbsp;3905</A> of this title. Establishments may be audited by the Tax Commission to verify such eligibility. Once the establishment is approved, an agreement shall be deemed to exist between the establishment and the State of Oklahoma, requiring incentive payments to be made for a seven-year period as long as the establishment retains its eligibility and within the limitations of the Small Employer Quality Jobs Incentive Act which existed at the time of such approval. Any establishment which has been approved for incentive payments prior to July 1, 2002, shall continue to receive such payments pursuant to the laws as they existed prior to July 1, 2002, for any period of time of the original five-year period for such payments remaining after July 1, 2002.</P>
<P>E. For any contract executed by an establishment on or after August 2, 2018, five percent (5%) of the quarterly incentive payment amount shall be transferred by the Oklahoma Tax Commission to the Oklahoma Quick Action Closing Fund.</P>
