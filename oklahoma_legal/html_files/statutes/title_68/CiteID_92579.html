<P>J. Any person receiving tax credits pursuant to the provisions of this section shall apply the credits against taxes payable or, subject to the limitation that credits earned after December 31, 2013, shall not be transferred, shall transfer the credits as provided in this section or, for credits earned on or after January 1, 2014, shall receive a refund pursuant to the provisions of subsection L of this section. Credits shall not be used to lower the price of any Oklahoma-mined coal sold that is produced by a subsidiary of the person receiving a tax credit under this section to other buyers of the Oklahoma-mined coal.</P>
<P>K. Except as provided by paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, the credits allowed by subsections B, C, D, E and F of this section, upon election of the taxpayer, shall be treated and may be claimed as a payment of tax, a prepayment of tax or a payment of estimated tax for purposes of Section 1803 <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=92565">or 2355</A> of this title or Section 624 or 628 of Title 36 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P>L. 1. With respect to credits allowed pursuant to the provisions of subsections B, C, D, E and F of this section earned prior to January 1, 2014, but not used in any tax year may be carried over in order to each of the five (5) years following the year of qualification.</P>
<P>2. With respect to credits allowed pursuant to the provisions of subsections B, C, D, E and F of this section which are earned but not used, based upon activity occurring on or after January 1, 2014, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall, at the taxpayer's election, refund directly to the taxpayer eighty-five percent (85%) of the face amount of such credits. The direct refund of the credits pursuant to this paragraph shall be available to all taxpayers, including, without limitation, pass-through entities and taxpayers subject to <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=92565">Section 2355</A> of this title. The amount of any direct refund of credits actually received at the eighty-five percent (85%) level by the taxpayer pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to the tax imposed by <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=92565">Section 2355</A> of this title. If the pass-through entity does not file a claim for a direct refund, the pass-through entity shall allocate the credit to one or more of the shareholders, partners or members of the pass-through entity; provided, the total of all credits refunded or allocated shall not exceed the amount of the credit or refund to which the pass-through entity is entitled. For the purposes of this paragraph, "pass-through entity" means a corporation that for the applicable tax year is treated as an S corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, trust or limited liability company that for the applicable tax year is not taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.</P>
<P>M. No credit otherwise authorized by the provisions of this section may be claimed for any event, transaction, investment, expenditure or other act occurring on or after July 1, 2010, for which the credit would otherwise be allowable. The provisions of this subsection shall cease to be operative on July 1, 2012. Beginning July 1, 2012, the credit authorized by this section may be claimed for any event, transaction, investment, expenditure or other act occurring on or after July 1, 2012, according to the provisions of this section.</P>
<P>N. Except as otherwise provided by this section, any credits calculated pursuant to paragraphs 3 or 4 of subsection B or subsection D of this section for activities occurring on or after January 1, 2016, the amount of credit allowed shall be equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the amount otherwise provided.</P>
<P>O. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the total amount of credits authorized by this section used to offset tax or paid as a refund shall be adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00). The Tax Commission shall annually calculate and publish a percentage by which the credits authorized by this section shall be reduced so the total amount of credits used to offset tax or paid as a refund does not exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) per year. The formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in the second preceding year.</P>
<P>P. Pursuant to subsection O of this section, in the event the total tax credits authorized by this section exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) but shall factor such excess into the percentage adjustment formula for subsequent years.</P>
<P>Q. Any credits authorized by this section not used or unable to be used because of the provisions of subsection O or P of this section may be carried over until such credits are fully used.</P>
