</div>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. 1. Every tobacco product manufacturer whose 
cigarettes are sold in this state, whether directly or through a distributor, 
retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries, shall execute and deliver on 
a form or in the manner prescribed by the Attorney General a certification to 
the Oklahoma Tax Commission and Attorney General, no later than April 30 of each 
year, certifying under penalty of perjury that, as of the date of certification, 
the tobacco product manufacturer either:</P>
<P dir=ltr>a. is a participating manufacturer, or</P>
<P dir=ltr>b. is in full compliance with the provisions of Sections 600.21 
through 600.23 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P dir=ltr>2. A participating manufacturer shall include in its certification a 
list of its brand families. The participating manufacturer shall update the list 
thirty (30) calendar days prior to any addition to or modification of its brand 
families by executing and delivering a supplemental certification to the 
Attorney General and the Oklahoma Tax Commission.</P>
<P dir=ltr>3. A nonparticipating manufacturer shall include in its 
certification:</P>
<P dir=ltr>a. a list of all of its brand families and the number of units sold 
for each brand family that were sold in the state during the preceding calendar 
year, and</P>
<P dir=ltr>b. a list of all of its brand families that have been sold in the 
state at any time during the current calendar year:</P>
<P dir=ltr>(1) indicating, by an asterisk, any brand family sold in the state 
during the preceding calendar year that is no longer being sold in the state as 
of the date of the certification, and</P>
<P dir=ltr>(2) identifying by name and address any other manufacturer of the 
brand families in the preceding or current calendar year.</P>
<P dir=ltr>The nonparticipating manufacturer shall update the list thirty (30) 
calendar days prior to any corrected final addition to or modification of its 
brand families by executing and delivering a supplemental certification to the 
Attorney General and the Oklahoma Tax Commission.</P>
<P dir=ltr>4. In the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, the certification 
shall further certify that the nonparticipating manufacturer:</P>
<P dir=ltr>a. is registered to do business in the state or has appointed a 
resident agent for service of process and provided notice thereof as required by 
Section&nbsp;360.5 of this title,</P>
<P dir=ltr>b. has established and continues to maintain a qualified escrow fund, 
and</P>
<P dir=ltr>c. has executed a qualified escrow agreement that has been reviewed 
and approved by the Attorney General and that governs the qualified escrow fund 
as defined in Section 600.22 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes that the 
nonparticipating manufacturer is in full compliance with the provisions of 
Sections 600.21 through 600.23 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes and the 
Master Settlement Agreement Complementary Act and any rules promulgated pursuant 
to the Master Settlement Agreement Complementary Act.</P>
<P dir=ltr>5. The nonparticipating manufacturer shall include with 
certification:</P>
<P dir=ltr>a. the name, address, and telephone number of the financial 
institution with which the nonparticipating manufacturer has established its 
qualified escrow fund,</P>
<P dir=ltr>b. the account number of its qualified escrow fund and any subaccount 
number for the State of Oklahoma,</P>
<P dir=ltr>c. the amount the nonparticipating manufacturer placed in the 
qualified escrow fund for cigarettes sold in Oklahoma during the preceding 
calendar year, the date and amount of each deposit to the fund, and any evidence 
or verification as may be deemed necessary by the Attorney General to confirm 
the information required by this paragraph, and</P>
<P dir=ltr>d. the amount and date of any withdrawal or transfer of funds the 
nonparticipating manufacturer made at any time from the qualified escrow fund or 
from any other qualified escrow fund into which the nonparticipating 
manufacturer made escrow payments pursuant to Section 600.23 of Title 37 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes rules promulgated thereto.</P>
<P dir=ltr>6. In the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer located outside of 
the United States, the certification shall further certify that the 
nonparticipating manufacturer has provided a declaration from each of its 
importers into the United States of any of its brand families to be sold in 
Oklahoma. The declaration shall be on a form prescribed by the Attorney General 
and shall state that such importer accepts joint and several liability with the 
nonparticipating manufacturer for all escrow deposits due, for all penalties 
assessed and for payment of all costs and attorney fees imposed in accordance 
with Sections 600.21 through 600.23 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Such 
declaration shall appoint for the declaration a resident agent for service of 
process in Oklahoma in accordance with Section 360.5 of this title.</P>
<P dir=ltr>7. A tobacco product manufacturer may not include a brand family in 
its certification unless:</P>
<P dir=ltr>a. in the case of a participating manufacturer, the participating 
manufacturer affirms that the brand family is to be deemed to be its cigarettes 
for purposes of calculating its payments under the Master Settlement Agreement 
for the relevant year, in the volume and shares determined pursuant to the 
Master Settlement Agreement, or</P>
<P dir=ltr>b. in the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, the 
nonparticipating manufacturer affirms that the brand family is to be deemed to 
be its cigarettes for purposes of the provisions of Sections 600.21 through 
600.23 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P><STRIKE>
<P dir=ltr></STRIKE>8. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or 
otherwise affecting the right of this state to maintain that a brand family 
constitutes cigarettes of a different tobacco product manufacturer for purposes 
of calculating payments under the Master Settlement Agreement or for purposes of 
Sections 600.21 through 600.23 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</P><STRIKE>
<P></STRIKE>9. Tobacco product manufacturers shall maintain all invoices and 
documentation of sales and other information relied upon for the certification 
for a period of five (5) years, unless otherwise required by law to maintain 
them for a greater period of time.</P>
<P>10. At the time a manufacturer submits a yearly written certification 
pursuant to this section, the manufacturer shall pay to the Office of the 
Attorney General a fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). All fees collected 
pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in the Attorney Generals 
Revolving Fund.</P>
<P dir=ltr>B. 1. Not later than ninety (90) calendar days after this act takes 
effect, the Attorney General shall develop and publish on its website a 
directory listing all tobacco product manufacturers that have provided current 
and accurate certifications conforming to the requirements of subparagraph a of 
paragraph 4 of subsection A of this section and all brand families that are 
listed in the certifications, except as otherwise provided in this section.</P>
<P dir=ltr>2. The Attorney General shall not include or retain in the directory 
the name or brand families of any nonparticipating manufacturer that has failed 
to provide the required certification or whose certification the Attorney 
General determines is not in compliance with paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of 
subsection A of this section, unless the Attorney General has determined that a 
violation has been cured to the satisfaction of the Attorney General.</P>
<P dir=ltr>3. Neither a tobacco product manufacturer nor brand family shall be 
included or retained in the directory if the Attorney General concludes, in the 
case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, that:</P>
<P dir=ltr>a. any escrow payment required pursuant to Section 600.23 of Title 37 
of the Oklahoma Statutes for any period for any brand family, whether or not 
listed by the nonparticipating manufacturer, has not been fully paid into a 
qualified escrow fund governed by a qualified escrow agreement that has been 
approved by the Attorney General,</P>
<P dir=ltr>b. any outstanding final judgment, including interest thereon, for a 
violation of the provisions of Sections 600.21 through 600.23 of Title 37 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes has not been fully satisfied for the brand family or 
manufacturer, or</P>
<P dir=ltr>c. the nonparticipating manufacturer or such tobacco product 
manufacturer fails to provide reasonable assurance that it will comply with the 
requirements of this section or Sections 600.21 through 600.23 of Title 37 of 
the Oklahoma Statutes, or the manufacturer has knowingly failed to disclose any 
material information required or knowingly made any material false statement in 
the certification of any supporting information or documentation provided. As 
used in this subparagraph, reasonable assurances may include information and 
documentation establishing to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that a 
failure to pay in Oklahoma or elsewhere was the result of a good-faith dispute 
over the payment obligation.</P>
<P dir=ltr>4. The Attorney General shall update the directory as necessary in 
order to correct mistakes and to add or remove a tobacco product manufacturer or 
brand family to keep the directory in conformity with the requirements of the 
Master Settlement Agreement Complementary Act.</P>
<P dir=ltr>5. Every stamping agent shall provide and update, as necessary, an 
electronic mail address to the Oklahoma Tax Commission and the Attorney General 
for the purpose of receiving any notifications as may be required by the Master 
Settlement Agreement Complementary Act.</P>
<P dir=ltr>6. Any nonparticipating manufacturer may request, by facsimile 
transmission or other means to the Attorney Generals Tobacco Enforcement Unit, 
information regarding its current compliance status pursuant to this act and to 
Sections 600.21 through 600.23 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Upon 
receipt of such request, the Attorney General shall inform the requesting 
nonparticipating manufacturer of its current compliance status before close of 
business within three (3) business days.</P>
<P dir=ltr>C. It shall be unlawful for any person to:</P>
<P dir=ltr>1. Affix a stamp to a package or other container of cigarettes of a 
tobacco product manufacturer or brand family not included in the directory; 
and</P>
<P dir=ltr>2. Sell, offer, or possess for sale, in this state, or import for 
personal consumption in this state, cigarettes of a tobacco product manufacturer 
or brand family not included in the directory.</P>
