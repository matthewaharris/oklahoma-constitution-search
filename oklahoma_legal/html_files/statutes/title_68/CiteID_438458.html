<P><FONT size=2>A. The tax levied hereunder shall be due and payable on the 
first day of each month, except as herein provided, by any person liable to 
remit or pay any tax due under Section 1350 et seq. of this title. For the 
purpose of ascertaining the amount of the tax payable, it shall be the duty of 
all tax remitters, on or before the twentieth day of each month, to deliver to 
the Oklahoma Tax Commission, upon forms prescribed and furnished by it, sales 
tax reports signed under oath, showing the gross receipts or gross proceeds 
arising from all sales taxable or nontaxable under Section 1350 et seq. of this 
title during the preceding calendar month. Such reports shall show such further 
information as the Tax Commission may require to enable it to compute correctly 
and collect the tax herein levied. In addition to the information required on 
reports, the Tax Commission may request and the taxpayer must furnish any 
information deemed necessary for a correct computation of the tax levied herein. 
Such tax remitter shall compute and remit to the Tax Commission the required tax 
due for the preceding calendar month, the remittance or remittances of the tax 
to accompany the reports herein required. If not filed on or before the 
twentieth day of such month, the tax shall be delinquent from such date. Reports 
timely mailed shall be considered timely filed. If a report is not timely filed, 
interest shall be charged from the date the report should have been filed until 
the report is actually filed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Every person required to remit the tax due pursuant to this

engaged in selling lumber and other building materials, including cement and 
concrete, except for home centers classified under Industry No. 444110 of the 
North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Manual, shall remit and 
report as required in subsection A of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Taxes not paid on or before the due dates specified in this 
subsection shall be delinquent from such dates.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>E. In lieu of monthly reports, tax remitters or taxpayers who 
are classified as Group Three vendors in Section 1350 et seq. of this title or 
tax remitters or taxpayers whose total amount of tax liability for any one month 
does not exceed Fifty Dollars ($50.00) may file semiannual reports and remit 
taxes due thereunder to the Tax Commission on or before the twentieth day of 
January and July of each year for the preceding six-month period. If not paid on 
or before the twentieth day of such month, the tax shall be 
delinquent.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>F. It shall be the duty of every tax remitter required to make a 
sales tax report and pay any tax under Section 1350 et seq. of this title to 
keep and preserve suitable records of the gross daily sales together with 
invoices of purchases and sales, bills of lading, bills of sale and other 
pertinent records and documents which may be necessary to determine the amount 
of tax due hereunder and such other records of goods, wares and merchandise, and 
other subjects of taxation under Section 1350 et seq. of this title as will 
substantiate and prove the accuracy of such returns. It shall also be the duty 
of every person who makes sales for resale to keep records of such sales which 
shall be subject to examination by the Tax Commission or any authorized employee 
thereof while engaged in checking or auditing the records of any person required 
to make a report under the terms of Section 1350 et seq. of this title. All such 
records shall remain in Oklahoma and be preserved for a period of three (3) 
years, unless the Tax Commission, in writing, has authorized their destruction 
or disposal at an earlier date, and shall be open to examination at any time by 
the Tax Commission or by any of its duly authorized agents. The burden of 
proving that a sale was not a taxable sale shall be upon the person who made the 
sale.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>G. The purchaser must provide the vendor with the purchaser's 
sales tax permit number, the direct payment permit number or a copy of the 
direct payment permit if the sale is made within Oklahoma. In addition to 
furnishing the sales tax permit number to the vendor, the purchaser must certify 
in writing to the vendor that the purchaser is engaged in the business of 
reselling the articles purchased. Failure to so certify, or to falsely certify 
with the knowledge that the items purchased are not for resale, shall be 
sufficient grounds upon which the Tax Commission may cause the purchaser's sales 
tax permit to be canceled. Certification may be made on the bill, invoice or 
sales slip retained by the vendor or by furnishing a certification letter to the 
seller which contains the following:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>1. The name and address of the purchaser;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>2. The sales tax permit number of the permit issued to the 
purchaser;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>3. A statement that the purchaser is engaged in the business of 
reselling the articles purchased, if applicable;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>4. A statement that the articles purchased are purchased for 
resale, if applicable; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>5. The signature of the purchaser or a person authorized to 
legally bind the purchaser.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>H. If a sales tax permit holder purchases goods, wares and 
merchandise from a vendor on a regular basis, then the permit holder may furnish 
the certification letter described in subsection G of this section to the vendor 
and the vendor may subsequently make sales of tangible personal property to the 
permit holder without requiring a certification letter or certification 
statement for each subsequent sale. The permit holder must notify the seller of 
all purchases which are not for resale and remit the applicable amount of tax 
thereon. If the permit holder fails to notify the vendor of purchases not 
intended for resale, then sufficient grounds shall exist for the Tax Commission 
to cancel the sales tax permit of the permit holder who so failed to notify the 
vendor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I. In lieu of filing reports as required in subsection A of this 
section, tax remitters or taxpayers who agree to participate in the Tax 
Commissions electronic funds transfer and electronic data interchange programs 
may file according to the following schedule:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>1. For sales from the first day through the fifteenth day of 
each month, the tax shall be due and payable on the twentieth day of such month 
and remitted to the Tax Commission by electronic funds transfer. A taxpayer will 
be considered to have complied with the reporting requirements of this paragraph 
if, on or before the twentieth day of such month, the taxpayer paid at least 
ninety percent (90%) of the liability for that fifteen-day period or at least 
fifty percent (50%) of the taxpayers liability in the immediate preceding 
calendar year for the same month as the month in which the fifteen-day period 
occurs; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>2. For sales from the sixteenth day through the end of each 
month, the tax shall be due and payable on the twentieth day of the following 
month and remitted to the Tax Commission by electronic funds 
transfer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Every person required to remit the tax due pursuant to this 
subsection shall file its monthly sales tax report in accordance with the Tax 
Commissions electronic data interchange program on the twentieth day of the 
month following the month the sales occurred.</FONT></P>
