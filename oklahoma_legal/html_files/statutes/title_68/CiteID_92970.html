<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. &nbsp;On the first day of January of each year, the county assessor of the county in which a manufactured home is located shall list, assess and tax such manufactured home as required by the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92969">Section 2812</a> of this title and the Ad Valorem Tax Code.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;In addition to the other requirements prescribed by law for the listing and assessing of real property pursuant to the provisions of the Ad Valorem Tax Code, when listing the value of real property on which a manufactured home is located and owned by the person owning the manufactured home and when listing the value of the improvements thereon, the county assessor shall separately describe and identify the value of the manufactured home apart from other real property and the value of the other improvements thereon. &nbsp;The value of the real property, the manufactured home, and the other improvements shall be shown separately.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;Except as authorized by subsection E of this section, when a manufactured home is moved, or whenever title to a manufactured home is transferred, any county treasurer shall collect all ad valorem taxes due for the current calendar year and all delinquent taxes due and owing prior to the change of title or location and shall issue a receipt of taxes paid, which shall be a Form 936, and a tax payment decal. &nbsp;These transactions may be handled by mail or facsimile transmission at the option of the taxpayer, except for tax payments which shall be handled either by mail or in person.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;After issuance of a receipt of taxes paid and a decal pursuant to the provisions of subsection C of this section and after notification by the county treasurer of such payment, the county assessor of the county in which the manufactured home is located shall furnish to the county assessor of the county where the manufactured home is to be located, the following information:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;The name of the owner of the manufactured home;</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;The serial number or identification number of the manufactured home;</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;The registration number given to the manufactured home by Service Oklahoma;</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;The address or legal description where the manufactured home is to be located;</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;The actual retail selling price of the manufactured home, excluding Oklahoma state taxes; and</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;Any other information necessary to enable the county assessor to list and assess the proper ad valorem taxes for the manufactured home for the following year.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;When lawfully repossessing a manufactured home which has been listed and assessed as real property pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92969">Section 2812</a> of this title, a holder of a perfected security interest in the home is authorized to pay the ad valorem taxes for the full current year and any registration fees or ad valorem taxes which may be due for any prior year on the manufactured home based on the assessed value of the home pursuant to the provisions of subsection B of this section apart from other real property and the other improvements thereon. &nbsp;When lawfully repossessing a manufactured home which has been listed and assessed as personal property pursuant to the provisions of subsection B of Section 2812 of this title, a holder of a perfected security interest in the home is authorized to pay the ad valorem taxes for the full current year and any registration fees or ad valorem taxes which may be due for any prior years. &nbsp;The county treasurer shall issue a receipt of taxes paid to said holder and a decal showing the payment of such taxes. Such receipt shall be issued notwithstanding the existence of a tax sale certificate issued as a result of a tax sale to a purchaser of property upon which a manufactured home is located and for which the holder of a perfected security interest makes payment as authorized by this subsection. &nbsp;Such receipt shall be issued if the procedures prescribed by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=93157">Section 3106</a> of this title are followed. &nbsp;If a tax sale certificate has been issued as required by law and the notice of sale contained the statement concerning the right of a secured party to repossess the manufactured home, the amount of taxes paid by the holder of the security interest shall be refunded to the holder of the tax sale certificate. &nbsp;The receipt shall be evidence of payment of the ad valorem taxes for purposes of obtaining a permit. Service Oklahoma shall issue a permit immediately to the holder of a perfected security interest or licensed representative thereof, if the holder or representative is bonded by the state, to move the manufactured home to a secure location with a repossession affidavit. &nbsp;However, all excise taxes and ad valorem taxes due on such a manufactured home shall be required to be paid within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the permit. &nbsp;A certificate of title for a manufactured home shall not be issued pursuant to a repossession prior to the furnishing of proof satisfactory to Service Oklahoma or the licensed operator that all ad valorem taxes due have been paid. &nbsp;If the home is subject to registration pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, the holder of a perfected security interest in a manufactured home may repossess the manufactured home and transport the manufactured home within the state for the purpose of securing the property after registering the manufactured home pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440191">Section 1113</a> or <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83058">1117 of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;The county assessor shall issue a special waiver and a commercial move affidavit for the second through the sixth day of the first month of the following year to allow a manufactured home which is used for commercial purposes to be moved during the first five (5) days in January without a Form 936 or a tax decal. &nbsp;All registration fees, excise taxes or ad valorem taxes due on the manufactured home shall be required to be paid within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the special waiver and commercial move affidavit. &nbsp;A business entity applying for a special waiver and a commercial move affidavit pursuant to this paragraph shall provide the county assessor with the information required by subsection B of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=82464">Section 14-103D of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. &nbsp;No individual county assessor shall issue any business entity more than ten special waivers and commercial move affidavits in a calendar year. &nbsp;As used in this paragraph, "manufactured home used for commercial purposes" means a manufactured home owned by any lawfully recognized business entity the primary purpose of which is to provide temporary housing for the employees or contractors of such business entity.</p>

<p>F. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;The decal shall be affixed to the manufactured home license plate as evidence of the ad valorem tax paid and shall remain on the license plate, which shall be affixed to the exterior of the manufactured home, while the manufactured home is in transit.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to transport or cause to be transported a manufactured home without the decal affixed as required by this section or without a special waiver and affidavit as provided in subsection E of this section.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;The decal issued pursuant to subsection C of this section shall be of such size, color, design and numbering as Service Oklahoma may direct. &nbsp;The tax payment decals shall be made with reflectionized material so as to provide effective and dependable brighteners during the service period for which the tax payment decal is issued. Service Oklahoma shall issue such tax payment decals to the various county treasurers of the state in order for a manufactured home owner or repossessor to move the manufactured home.</p>
