<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>The following property shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation:</p>

<p>1. All property of the United States, and such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations existing at statehood between the Indians and the United States government, or by reason of federal laws in effect at statehood, during the time such treaties or federal laws are in force and effect. In instances where a federal agency has obtained title to property through foreclosure, voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy, which was previously subject to ad valorem taxation, the property may continue to be assessed for ad valorem taxes if such federal agency has agreed to pay such taxes;</p>

<p>2. All property of this state, and of the counties, school districts, and municipalities of this state, including property acquired for the use of such entities pursuant to the terms of a lease-purchase agreement which provides for the passage of title or the release of security interest, if applicable, upon payment of all rental payments and an additional nominal amount;</p>

<p>3. All property of any college or school, provided such property is devoted exclusively and directly to the appropriate objects of such college or school within this state and all property used exclusively for nonprofit schools and colleges;</p>

<p>4. The books, papers, furniture and scientific or other apparatus pertaining to any institution, college or society referred to in paragraph 3 of this section, and devoted exclusively and directly for the purpose above contemplated, and the like property of students in any such institution or college, while such property is used for the purpose of their education;</p>

<p>5. All fraternal orphan homes and other orphan homes;</p>

<p>6. All property used for free public libraries, free museums, public cemeteries, or free public schools;</p>

<p>7. All property used exclusively and directly for fraternal or religious purposes within this state. For purposes of this paragraph, an exemption based on religious purposes includes real property owned by a church which allows its premises to be used by an entity if such entity is not required to make rental payments to the church, is not required to execute a formal lease agreement with respect to its occupancy of the church premises and conducts instruction of children from any or all grades for ages preschool through twelfth grade, including religious instruction consistent with the doctrines of the church the premises of which are being used for that purpose. For purposes of this paragraph, a requirement by a church to be reimbursed by the entity for utility expenses, janitorial services or similar expenses shall not be a basis upon which to remove or deny the exempt status of church property. Exempt status of church property shall not be removed nor shall church property be allocated between taxable and exempt status based on the use of church premises by an entity as described by this paragraph.</p>

<p>For purposes of administering the exemption authorized by this section and in order to determine whether a single family residential property is used exclusively and directly for fraternal or religious purposes, the fair cash value of a single family residential property, for which an exemption is claimed as authorized by this subsection, in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) for the applicable assessment year shall not be exempt from taxation;</p>

<p>8. All property of any charitable institution organized or chartered under the laws of this state as a nonprofit or charitable institution, provided the net income from such property is used exclusively within this state for charitable purposes and no part of such income inures to the benefit of any private stockholder, including property which is not leased or rented to any person other than a governmental body, a charitable institution or a member of the general public who is authorized to be a tenant in property owned by a charitable institution under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and which includes but is not limited to an institution that either:</p>

<p>a. additionally satisfies the income standards set forth in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 96-32, which may be audited by the county assessor of the applicable county, in addition to other requirements of this subparagraph, as a condition of obtaining and maintaining the exemption, if:</p>

<p>(1) the property provides residential rental accommodations regardless of whether services or meals are provided, and</p>

<p>(2) the property:</p>

<p>(a) is occupied as of the applicable January 1 assessment date if the structure is a single-family dwelling, or</p>

<p>(b) has an average seventy-five percent (75%) occupancy rate, based upon the total number of units suitable for occupancy, during the calendar year preceding the applicable January 1 assessment date if the property contains multiple structures suitable for multi-family housing. The owner of any property subject to the occupancy requirements prescribed herein shall submit a report to the county assessor of the county in which the property is located no later than December 15 each year regarding the occupancy rate for the preceding eleven (11) months. If the report indicates that the average occupancy rate was less than seventy-five percent (75%), the county assessor shall determine the taxable value of the property for the succeeding assessment year and the property shall not be exempt for any subsequent assessment year unless the average occupancy rate is at least seventy-five percent (75%) during the succeeding eleven-month period. Except as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=85805">Section 178.6 of Title 60</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, no asset consisting of a single-family or multi-family dwelling unit owned by an entity the property of which would otherwise be exempt pursuant to subparagraph a of this paragraph shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation if any such dwelling unit was improved with or acquired with any portion of proceeds from the sale of obligations issued by any entity organized pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438402">Section 176 of Title 60</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes if the interest income derived from such obligations is exempt from federal income tax, or</p>

<p>b. (1) for a facility constructed prior to January 1, 2006, is a continuum of care retirement community providing housing for the aged, licensed under Oklahoma law, owned by a nonprofit entity recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity and located in a county with a population of more than five hundred thousand (500,000) according to the latest Federal Decennial Census, and</p>

<p>ii. owned by a nonprofit entity recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity, and</p>

<p>iii. is located in any county of the state regardless of population;</p>

<p>9. All property used exclusively and directly for charitable purposes within this state, provided the charity using said property does not pay any rent or remuneration to the owner thereof unless the owner is a charitable institution described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 501(c)(3), or a veterans' organization described in Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 501(c)(19);</p>

<p>10. All property of any hospital established, organized and operated by any person, partnership, association, organization, trust, or corporation, as a nonprofit and charitable hospital, provided the property and net income from such hospital are used directly, solely, and exclusively within this state for charitable purposes and that no part of such income shall inure to the benefit of any individual, person, partner, shareholder, or stockholder, and provided further that such hospital facilities shall be open to the public without discrimination as to race, color or creed and regardless of ability to pay, and that such hospital is licensed and otherwise complies with the laws of this state relating to the licensing and regulation of hospitals;</p>

<p>11. All libraries and office equipment of ministers of the Gospel actively engaged in ministerial work in the State of Oklahoma, where said libraries and office equipment are being used by said ministers in their ministerial work, shall be deemed to be used exclusively for religious purposes and are declared to be within the meaning of the term "religious purposes" as used in Article X, Section 6 of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma;</p>

<p>12. Household goods, tools, implements and livestock of every person maintaining a home, not exceeding One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) in value or One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) in value if Article X, Section 6 of the Oklahoma Constitution provides for an exemption in such amount; and in addition thereto, there shall be exempt from taxation on personal property the further sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) to all enlisted and commissioned personnel, whether on active duty or honorably discharged, who served in the Armed Forces of the United States during:</p>
