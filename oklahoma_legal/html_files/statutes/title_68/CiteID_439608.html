<P>A. In accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this act, any county of 
this state may levy a sales tax of not to exceed two percent (2%) upon the gross 
proceeds or gross receipts derived from all sales or services in the county upon 
which a consumer's sales tax is levied by this state. Before a sales tax may be 
levied by the county, the imposition of the tax shall first be approved by a 
majority of the registered voters of the county voting thereon at a special 
election called by the board of county commissioners or by initiative petition 
signed by not less than five percent (5%) of the registered voters of the county 
who were registered at the time of the last general election. However, if a 
majority of the registered voters of a county voting fail to approve such a tax, 
the board of county commissioners shall not call another special election for 
such purpose for six (6) months. Any sales tax approved by the registered voters 
of a county shall be applicable only when the point of sale is within the 
territorial limits of such county. Any sales tax levied or any change in the 
rate of a sales tax levied pursuant to the provisions of this section shall 
become effective on the first day of the calendar quarter following approval by 
the voters of the county unless another effective date, which shall also be on 
the first day of a calendar quarter, is specified in the ordinance or resolution 
levying the sales tax or changing the rate of sales tax.</P>
<P>B. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall give notice to all vendors of a rate 
change at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the rate change. 
Provided, for purchases from printed catalogs wherein the purchaser computed the 
tax based upon local tax rates published in the catalog, the rate change shall 
not be effective until the first day of a calendar quarter after a minimum of 
one hundred twenty (120) days' notice to vendors. Failure to give notice as 
required by this section shall delay the effective date of the rate change to 
the first day of the next calendar quarter.</P>
<P>C. Initiative petitions calling for a special election concerning county 
sales tax proposals shall be in accordance with Sections 2, 3, 3.1, 6, 18 and 24 
of Title 34 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Petitions shall be submitted to the office 
of county clerk for approval as to form prior to circulation. Following 
approval, the petitioner shall have ninety (90) days to secure the required 
signatures. After securing the requisite number of signatures, the petitioner 
shall submit the petition and signatures to the county clerk. Following the 
verification of signatures, the county clerk shall present the petition to the 
board of county commissioners. The special election shall be held within sixty 
(60) days of receiving the petition. The ballot title presented to the voters at 
the special election shall be identical to the ballot as presented in the 
initiative petition.</P>
<P>D. Subject to the provisions of Section 1357.10 of this title, all items that 
are exempt from the state sales tax shall be exempt from any sales tax levied by 
a county.</P>
<P>E. Any sales tax which may be levied by a county shall be designated for a 
particular purpose. Such purposes may include, but are not limited to, projects 
owned by the state, any agency or instrumentality thereof, the county and/or any 
political subdivision located in whole or in part within such county, regional 
development, economic development, common education, general operations, capital 
improvements, county roads, weather modification or any other purpose deemed, by 
a majority vote of the county commissioners or as stated by initiative petition, 
to be necessary to promote safety, security and the general well-being of the 
people, including any authorized purpose pursuant to the Oklahoma Community 
Economic Development Pooled Finance Act. The county shall identify the purpose 
of the sales tax when it is presented to the voters pursuant to the provisions 
of subsection A of this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section 
and except as required by the Oklahoma Community Economic Development Pooled 
Finance Act, the proceeds of any sales tax levied by a county shall be deposited 
in the general revenue or sales tax revolving fund of the county and shall be 
used only for the purpose for which such sales tax was designated. If the 
proceeds of any sales tax levied by a county pursuant to this section are 
pledged for the purpose of retiring indebtedness incurred for the specific 
purpose for which the sales tax is imposed, the sales tax shall not be repealed 
until such time as the indebtedness is retired. However, in no event shall the 
life of the tax be extended beyond the duration approved by the voters of the 
county.</P>
<P>F. 1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any county that has 
approved a sales tax for the construction, support or operation of a county 
hospital may continue to collect such tax if such hospital is subsequently sold. 
Such collection shall only continue if the county remains indebted for the past 
construction, support or operation of such hospital. The collection may continue 
only until the debt is repaid or for the stated term of the sales tax, whichever 
period is shorter.</P>
<P>2. If the construction, support or operation of a hospital is funded through 
the levy of a county sales tax pursuant to this section and such hospital is 
subsequently sold, the county levying the tax may dissolve the governing board 
of such hospital following the sale. Upon the sale of the hospital and 
dissolution of any governing board, the county is relieved of any future 
liability for the operation of such hospital.</P>
<P>G. Proceeds from any sales tax levied that is designated to be used solely by 
the sheriff for the operation of the office of sheriff shall be placed in the 
special revenue account of the sheriff.</P>
<P>H. The life of the tax could be limited or unlimited in duration. The county 
shall identify the duration of the tax when it is presented to the voters 
pursuant to the provisions of subsections A and C of this section. The maximum 
duration of a levy imposed pursuant to Section 891.14 of Title 62 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes shall be no longer than allowed pursuant to the Oklahoma 
Community Economic Development Pooled Finance Act.</P>
<P>I. Except for the levies imposed pursuant to Section 891.14 of Title 62 of 
the Oklahoma Statutes, there are hereby created one or more county sales tax 
revolving funds in each county which levies a sales tax under this section if 
any or all of the proceeds of such tax are not to be deposited in the general 
revenue fund of the county or comply with the provisions of subsection G of this 
section. Each such revolving fund shall be designated for a particular purpose 
and shall consist of all monies generated by such sales tax which are designated 
for such purpose. Monies in such funds shall only be expended for the purposes 
specifically designated as required by this section. A county sales tax 
revolving fund shall be a continuing fund not subject to fiscal year 
limitations.</P>
<P>J. In the case of a levy submitted for voter approval pursuant to Section 
891.14 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma Statutes, taxes levied by a county shall not 
become valid until the ordinance or resolution setting the rate of the levy 
shall have been approved by a majority vote of the registered voters of each 
such county voting on such question at a special election. Elections conducted 
pursuant to questions submitted pursuant to Section 891.14 of Title 62 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes shall be conducted on the same date or in a sequence that 
provides that the last vote required for approval by all participating counties 
or municipalities occurs not later than thirty (30) days after the date upon 
which the first vote occurs.</P>
