<FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>
<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. A qualified federal contractor may receive 
quarterly incentive payments for renewable ten-year periods from the Oklahoma 
Tax Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program 
Act and the provisions of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The amount of such payments shall be equal to a 
net benefit rate of not less than twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.25%), 
but not greater than two percent (2%), multiplied by the total qualified labor 
hours worked by employees of the federal contractor or employees of a qualified 
federal subcontractor, or both, pursuant to a qualified federal contract for a 
calendar quarter as verified by the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission and 
certified by a qualified federal contractor verifier. The net benefit rate for a 
qualified federal contractor shall be scaled to annual subcontracting goals that 
account for both total qualified subcontract labor hours and the ratio of 
qualified subcontract labor hours to total qualified labor hours. Unless limited 
by the cost/benefit analysis, the net benefit rate shall:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Not exceed twenty-five hundredths of one percent 
(0.25%) when annual qualified subcontract labor hours are less than Two Hundred 
Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) or when annual qualified subcontract labor is 
less than one percent (1%) of the annual total qualified labor hours 
claimed;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Not be less than five-tenths of one percent (0.5%) 
when subcontract goals are met with a minimum of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars 
($200,000.00) of annual total qualified subcontractor labor hours and these 
hours are a minimum of one percent (1%) of the annual total qualified hours 
claimed;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Not be less than one percent (1%) when subcontract 
goals are met with a minimum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) of annual 
total qualified subcontractor labor hours and when these hours represent a 
minimum of five percent (5%) of the annual total qualified hours 
claimed;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Not be less than one and five-tenths percent 
(1.5%) when subcontract goals are met with a minimum of Two Million Dollars 
($2,000,000.00) of annual total qualified subcontractor labor hours and these 
hours are a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the annual total qualified hours 
claimed; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Not be less than two percent (2.0%) when 
subcontract goals are met with a minimum of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00) 
of annual total qualified subcontractor labor hours and these hours are a 
minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the annual total qualified hours 
claimed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. In order to receive incentive payments, a 
qualified federal contractor shall apply to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce 
within one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of the award of a 
qualified federal contract or award of a new qualified subcontract under an 
existing qualified federal contract. The application shall be on a form 
prescribed by the Department and shall contain such information as may be 
required by the Department to determine if the applicant is qualified. Once 
qualified by the Department, the applicant shall submit qualified federal 
contracts to the federal contract verifier. The federal contract verifier shall 
establish with the applicant an information system(s) or contract(s) as may be 
required to certify the total qualified labor hours, qualified labor rates, and 
reimbursement through the qualified federal contract. A qualified federal 
contractor may apply for an effective date for a project, which shall not be 
more than twenty-four (24) months from the date the application is submitted to 
the Department. No state agency shall be required to make any payment to a 
qualified federal contract verifier for any information needed by the agency to 
perform any duty imposed upon it pursuant to the provisions of Section 3601 et 
seq. of this title. All costs for the federal contract verifier shall be 
reimbursed through value-added services on the qualified federal contract or 
other mechanisms agreed to by the federal contractor verifier and the federal 
contract performers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. In order to qualify to receive incentive payments 
as authorized by the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act, in addition to other 
qualifications specified herein, a qualified federal contractor shall be 
required to pay direct jobs an average annualized wage which equals or 
exceeds:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. One hundred ten percent (110%) of the average 
county wage as determined by the Department of Commerce based on the most recent 
U.S. Department of Commerce data for the county in which the new direct jobs are 
located. For purposes of this paragraph, health care premiums paid by the 
applicant for individuals in new direct jobs shall be included in the annualized 
wage; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. One hundred percent (100%) of the average county 
wage as that percentage is determined by the Department of Commerce based upon 
the most recent U.S. Department of Commerce data for the county in which the new 
jobs are located. For purposes of this paragraph, health care premiums paid by 
the applicant for individuals in new direct jobs shall not be included in the 
annualized wage.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Provided, no average wage requirement shall exceed 
Twenty-nine Thousand Four Hundred Nine Dollars ($29,409.00), in any county. This 
maximum wage threshold shall be indexed and modified from time to time based on 
the latest Consumer Price Index year-to-date percent change release as of the 
date of the annual average county wage data release from the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. For qualified subcontractor work, the qualified 
federal contractor shall have a minimum average qualified labor rate requirement 
paid to the subcontractor of Thirty-one Dollars ($31.00) per hour, in any 
county. This maximum wage threshold shall be indexed and modified from time to 
time based on the latest Consumer Price Index year-to-date percent change 
release as of the date of the annual average county wage data release from the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The Department shall determine if the applicant is 
qualified to receive incentive payments using information supplied to the 
Department by the qualified federal contractor verifier. The NAICS code or codes 
under which the federal government awarded the qualified federal contract shall 
be used to determine the basic industry for a qualified federal contractor. For 
federal contracts awarded under NAICS codes not within the definition of basic 
industry pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 3603 of this title, 
the Department of Commerce, with the federal contract verifier, may evaluate and 
utilize individual statement of work items that would qualify within a basic 
industry definition.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. If the applicant is determined to be qualified by 
the Department, the Department shall conduct a cost/benefit analysis to 
determine the estimated net direct state benefits and the net benefit rate, as 
provided by subsection B of this section, applicable for a ten-year period 
beginning with the first complete calendar quarter following the start date and 
to estimate the amount of gross payroll and total qualified labor hours for a 
ten-year period beginning with the first complete calendar quarter following the 
start date. In conducting such cost/benefit analysis, the Department shall 
consider quantitative factors, such as the anticipated level of new tax revenues 
to the state along with the added cost to the state of providing services, and 
such other criteria as deemed appropriate by the Department. In no event shall 
incentive payments, cumulatively, exceed the estimated net direct state 
benefits. Using this net cost/benefit analysis model, the Department may 
establish the renewable ten-year contract with a qualified federal contractor at 
the entity level to encompass any current or future qualified federal contracts 
that meet the cost/benefit analysis metrics as determined by the federal 
contractor verifier and confirmed by the Department.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. Upon approval of such an application, the 
Department shall notify the Tax Commission and shall provide it with a copy of 
the contract that has been cosigned by the federal contractor verifier and the 
results of the cost/benefit analysis. The Tax Commission may require the 
qualified federal contractor, federal contract verifier, and qualified 
subcontractors to submit such additional information as may be necessary to 
administer the provisions of the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act. The approved 
qualified federal contractor shall file quarterly claims with the Tax Commission 
and shall continue to file such quarterly claims during the ten-year incentive 
period to show its continued eligibility for incentive payments, as provided in 
Section 3606 of this title, or until it is no longer qualified to receive 
incentive payments. The qualified federal contractor may be audited by the Tax 
Commission to verify such eligibility. Once the qualified federal contractor is 
approved, an agreement shall be deemed to exist between the qualified federal 
contractor and the State of Oklahoma, requiring the continued incentive payment 
to be made as long as the qualified federal contractor retains its eligibility 
as defined in and established pursuant to this section and Sections 3603 and 
3606 of this title and within the limitations contained in the Oklahoma Quality 
Jobs Program Act, which existed at the time of such approval.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. For qualified federal contracts with periods of 
performance exceeding two (2) years, if the actual annual verified gross 
qualified labor hours for four (4) consecutive calendar quarters does not equal 
or exceed Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000.00) within three 
(3) years of the start date, or does not equal or exceed actual annual gross 
qualified labor hours of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars 
($2,500,000.00) at any other time during the ten-year period after the start 
date, the incentive payments shall not be made and shall not be resumed until 
such time as the actual annual qualified labor hours exceed Two Million Five 
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000.00).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. If the average annualized wage or minimum average 
qualified labor rate required by subsection H of this section is not met during 
any calendar quarter, the incentive payments shall not be made and shall not be 
resumed until such time as such requirements are met.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. Before approving a quarterly incentive payment for 
a qualified federal contract, the federal contract verifier must first determine 
through the Department that neither the qualified federal contractor nor the 
subcontractor are receiving incentive payments under the Oklahoma Quality Jobs 
Program Act, the Saving Quality Jobs Act, the 21st Century Quality Jobs 
Incentive Act or the Former Military Facility Development Act for the 
performance of the same such services under the qualified federal contract and 
is not qualified for approval of an application for incentive payments under the 
Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act, the Saving Quality Jobs Act, the 21st Century 
Quality Jobs Incentive Act or the Former Military Facility Development Act for 
the performance of the same such services under the qualified federal contract. 
If the qualified federal contractor or the subcontractor are receiving or have 
an approved application for incentive payments under the Oklahoma Quality Jobs 
Program Act, the Saving Quality Jobs Act, the 21st Century Quality Jobs 
Incentive Act or the Former Military Facility Development Act for the 
performance of the same such services under the qualified federal contract, each 
may choose to defer in part or in entirety the other incentives for the 
qualified federal contractor to receive the incentives pursuant to subsection B 
of this section. The federal contract verifier shall confirm any deferrals and 
ensure the total for all quality jobs incentive payments on any individual does 
not exceed the total net benefit to the state. Should neither the federal 
contractor nor the subcontractor defer in part or in entirety their incentive 
payments such that the total for all Quality Jobs incentive payments exceeds the 
total net benefit to the state, the priority for incentive payments shall go to 
the entity with the earliest recognized start date indentified within the 
current Department of Commerce Quality Jobs contract.</FONT></P>
