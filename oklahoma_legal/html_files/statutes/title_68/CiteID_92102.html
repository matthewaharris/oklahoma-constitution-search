<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. The Legislature hereby finds:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Some Indian tribes within the State of Oklahoma 
are engaged in the retail sales of motor fuels at locations within their 
sovereign territories;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Both Indian tribes and the government of the State 
of Oklahoma impose motor fuel taxes;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. By reason of the ruling of the United States 
Supreme Court in "Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Chickasaw Nation", 115 S.Ct. 2214 
(1995), the State of Oklahoma does not now collect state motor fuel taxes on 
sales made by Indian tribes. The Legislature hereby acknowledges that, as a 
matter of federal law, the existing law of the state may not be used to levy or 
enforce taxes on certain sales of motor fuel made by Indian tribes;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. It is mutually beneficial to the State of Oklahoma 
and the federally recognized Indian tribes of this state, exercising their 
sovereign powers, to enter into contracts as set forth in subsection B of this 
section, for the purpose of limiting litigation on the issue of state government 
taxation of motor fuel sales made by Indian tribes. It is in the interest of 
this state to resolve disputes between the state and federally recognized Indian 
tribes on this issue by entering into contracts under which the Indian tribes 
are in part compensated for any tribal motor fuel tax revenues the Indian tribes 
might lose by reason of the adoption and enforcement of this act. Such mutually 
beneficial agreements allow both the State of Oklahoma and the Indian tribes to 
benefit from tax revenues from sales of motor fuel on Indian country.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. In lieu of the refund procedure provided in 
subsection E of Section 14 of this act for the exemption provided for sales of 
motor fuels by an Indian tribe to its tribal members as provided in paragraph 10 
of Section 10 of this act, an Indian tribe, on its behalf and on behalf of its 
members, may elect to enter into a contract with the State of Oklahoma as 
provided in subsection C of this section.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The State of Oklahoma hereby makes the following 
offer to all federally recognized Indian tribes within this state which, if 
accepted, will constitute a contract between this state and the accepting tribe 
or tribes:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The accepting tribe shall agree that it will not 
challenge the constitutionality of this act or the application of this act to 
motor fuel sales on Indian country in any court or tribunal and shall include 
all state motor fuel taxes and assessments in the price of its motor fuel sales, 
including but not limited to sales to tribal members on tribal land. The 
accepting tribe shall agree as a material term of its agreement to abide with 
all parts of this act in its entirety and shall agree not to procure, or attempt 
to procure, motor fuel for sale in Indian country on which the tax imposed by 
this act has not been precollected as provided for herein;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. In consideration of this agreement by the tribe or 
tribes, the State of Oklahoma, through the Oklahoma Tax Commission, shall 
withhold a percentage of its motor fuel tax revenues, as specified in paragraph 
3 of this subsection, which shall be apportioned quarterly to the accepting 
Indian tribes. The funds apportioned as provided herein are deemed to be in lieu 
of tribal tax revenues that the tribes would otherwise have collected on sales 
of motor fuels. The first such apportionment shall be made not later than 
February 1, 1997, which shall be for motor fuels taxes received by the Tax 
Commission during the last calendar quarter of 1996, and subsequent 
apportionments shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after the end of 
each calendar quarter thereafter. The first such apportionment shall be made to 
all tribes which have elected and accepted the terms of the contract specified 
in this subsection before October 1, 1996. Any tribe electing and accepting the 
terms of the contract specified in this subsection on or after October 1, 1996, 
shall be eligible to receive quarterly apportionments beginning with the 
calendar quarter following such election;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The percentage of state motor fuel tax and 
assessment revenues collected pursuant to the provisions of this act which shall 
be withheld monthly and apportioned quarterly to accepting Indian tribes shall 
be as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. for the portion of the fiscal year beginning July 
1, 1996, for which this act is effective, three percent (3%),</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1997, four 
percent (4%), and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998, and 
for each fiscal year thereafter, four and one-half percent (4 1/2%);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The funds withheld by the Oklahoma Tax Commission 
pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection shall be apportioned quarterly to 
each accepting Indian tribe as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. each accepting Indian tribe shall receive a base 
quarterly sum of Six Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($6,250.00). If the 
gross state motor fuel tax revenues collected do not exceed One Hundred Million 
Dollars ($100,000,000.00) in any fiscal year, the provisions of this 
subparagraph shall not be applicable,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. to those tribes who were engaged in the sales of 
motor fuels during the fourth calendar quarter of the calendar year 
1996:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1996, an 
amount equal to ten cents ($0.10) per gallon of motor fuels sold by such tribe 
during the fourth calendar quarter of 1996,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1997, an 
amount equal to eight cents ($0.08) per gallon of motor fuels sold by such tribe 
during the fourth calendar quarter of 1996,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998, an 
amount equal to six cents ($0.06) per gallon of motor fuels sold by such tribe 
during the fourth calendar quarter of 1996,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1999, an 
amount equal to four cents ($0.04) per gallon of motor fuels sold by such tribe 
during the fourth calendar quarter of 1996, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(5) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2000, and 
thereafter for the duration of the contract, an amount equal to two cents 
($0.02) per gallon of motor fuels sold by such tribe during the fourth calendar 
quarter of 1996, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. after determination of amounts to be apportioned 
pursuant to subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph, the remainder shall be 
apportioned according to the proportion the accepting Indian tribe's total 
Oklahoma resident membership bears to the total Oklahoma tribal resident 
membership of all accepting Indian tribes;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The funds withheld by the Oklahoma Tax Commission 
and apportioned quarterly pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be 
used by the accepting tribe exclusively for tribal government programs limited 
to highway and bridge construction, health, education, corrections, and law 
enforcement;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. In the event, at any time during a calendar 
quarter, an accepting tribe selling motor fuel fails to procure, for whatever 
reason, motor fuel for sale in Indian country on which the tax imposed by this 
act has been precollected as provided in this act, or fails, for whatever 
reason, to include all state motor fuel taxes and assessments in the price of 
its motor fuels sales including, but not limited to, sales to tribal members on 
Indian country, the tribe shall not be eligible to receive an apportionment 
under this section for that calendar quarter. In such instances, the Tax 
Commission shall notify the tribe that its apportionment shall be withheld and 
the reasons therefor. The tribe shall have six (6) months from the date of 
issuance of the notice under this paragraph to file a legal action contesting 
the decision of the state to withhold its apportionment. The amount withheld 
from the tribe pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall not be 
apportioned and shall be withheld from all tribes until the expiration of the 
six-month limitation period and during the pendency of any legal action filed 
pursuant to this paragraph.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Each tribe shall provide to the Oklahoma Tax 
Commission an audit of its tribal membership or citizenship rolls certified by a 
certified public accountant showing the correct number of its respective tribal 
members by blood, excluding members of bands, tribal towns and other tribes or 
affiliates which may be included on its rolls but who are ineligible for tribal 
services and benefits. Only tribal members who reside within the State of 
Oklahoma shall be included in the audit. Citizens of tribal towns, bands of 
Indians and tribes who are also counted in the audits as members of another 
tribe participating in the contract provided for in this section and eligible to 
receive services from the tribe shall not be eligible to also participate under 
this section. Any tribal member who is also a member of another tribe may only 
be counted once for purposes of determining tribal membership. Those tribes who 
were engaged in the sales of motor fuels during the fourth calendar quarter of 
calendar year 1996 shall also provide certified audited reports on or before 
January 10, 1997, showing the quantity of motor fuels sold by them during that 
period. For all tribes electing to accept the terms of the contract specified in 
this subsection before October 1, 1996, the membership audit report shall be 
submitted on or before October 1, 1996, and not later than July 1 of each year 
thereafter. The information provided shall be the basis from which the Oklahoma 
Tax Commission shall calculate the distribution of the funds withheld pursuant 
to the provisions of this section. The State of Oklahoma shall be absolved of 
any liability if the information submitted pursuant to the provisions of this 
section is not correct. If such information is not submitted by an accepting or 
participating tribe by October 1, 1996, or in subsequent years by July 1, the 
Tax Commission shall calculate the distribution of the funds on the basis of the 
information previously submitted by that tribe. Notwithstanding the provisions 
of Section 205 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes, copies of the audits and 
reports shall be made available to any requesting participating 
tribes;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Acceptance of the offer contained in this section 
shall be made in writing to the Oklahoma Tax Commission, signed by the chief 
executive officer of the tribal government, stating that the tribe accepts, 
without condition, the terms of this section, and for the sole purpose of 
resolving disputes arising out of a contract entered into pursuant to the 
provisions of this section, the tribe waives its immunity from suit and 
liability in state and federal court. In addition, proof of adoption of an 
ordinance or resolution by the governing body of the tribe accepting without 
condition the terms of this section, and an effective waiver of its immunity, as 
specified herein, shall be required. Notwithstanding the enactment of any future 
legislation on this topic, the term of the contract created by the acceptance of 
this offer shall extend through and include fiscal year 2016 and shall be 
renewed for successive ten-year terms unless a tribe notifies the State of 
Oklahoma of its intention not to participate further or the State of Oklahoma 
notifies the tribe of its intent not to participate further. Notification by the 
tribe shall be made in the same manner as required by this paragraph for 
acceptance of the offer to participate in the contract. Notification by the 
state shall be made by the Governor in writing to the tribe, and such 
notification shall be filed with the Secretary of State;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. The State of Oklahoma hereby waives its immunities 
from suit granted by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States for the sole purpose of resolving disputes arising out of a contract 
entered into pursuant to the provisions of this section;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. Both the State of Oklahoma and the accepting 
Indian tribe recognize, respect and accept the fact that under applicable laws 
each is a sovereign with dominion over their respective territories and 
governments. By entering into this proposed intergovernmental contractual 
relationship, neither the state nor the tribe has, in any way, caused the 
other's sovereignty to be diminished;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. Members of accepting tribes shall not be 
individually eligible for the exemption provided in paragraph 10 of Section 10 
of this act. Apportionment of funds to accepting tribes pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraph 4 of this subsection are in part in lieu of the refunds 
to individual tribal members as provided in paragraph 10 of Section 10 of this 
act. Indian tribes shall continue to be eligible for the tribal government 
exemption provided in paragraph 7 of Section 10 of this act;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. A tribe accepting the offer contained in this 
section agrees to hold the state harmless from suit by its individual tribal 
members and further agrees that, if a final judgment is rendered against the 
state pursuant to such a suit, that the tribe will reimburse the state for the 
amount of any such judgment paid and any costs incurred by the state pursuant to 
such suit. If a tribe fails to make such reimbursement within ninety (90) days 
of demand by the Oklahoma Tax Commission, the state shall withhold such amount 
from the apportionment of funds to the tribe pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph 4 of this subsection; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>13. A tribe accepting the offer contained in this 
section agrees not to license or otherwise authorize an individual tribal member 
or other person or entity to make sales of motor fuel in violation of the terms 
of the contract.</FONT></P><B><I>
