<p>I. &nbsp;Total credits authorized by this section shall be allocated as follows:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;By January 10 of the year immediately following each calendar year, a scholarship-granting organization, an educational improvement grant organization, an eligible public school foundation, or public school district which accepts contributions pursuant to this section shall provide electronically to the Tax Commission information on each contribution accepted during such taxable year. &nbsp;At least once each taxable year, the entity making the report shall notify each contributor that Oklahoma law provides for a total, statewide cap on the amount of income tax credits allowed annually;</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;If the Tax Commission determines the total combined credits claimed for contributions made to organizations authorized pursuant to subsections C and D of this section during the most recently completed calendar year by all taxpayers are in excess of the statewide cap amount provided in paragraphs 3 and 4 of subsection E of this section, the Tax Commission shall first allocate any amount of credits not claimed for contributions made to scholarship-granting organizations, then shall determine the percentage of the contribution which establishes the proportionate share of the credit which may be claimed by any taxpayer so that the maximum credits authorized by this section are not exceeded.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;If the Tax Commission determines the total combined credits claimed for contributions made to organizations authorized pursuant to subsections C and D of this section during the most recently completed calendar year by all taxpayers are in excess of the per public school district cap pursuant to paragraph 4 of subsection E of this section, the Tax Commission shall first allocate any amount of credits not claimed for contributions made to other organizations authorized pursuant to subsections C and D of this section, then shall determine the percentage of the contribution which establishes the proportionate share of the credit which may be claimed by any taxpayer so that the maximum credits authorized by this section are not exceeded.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;Beginning for tax year 2016, credits earned, but not allowed due to the application of statewide caps provided in subsection E of this section will be considered suspended and authorized to be used in the next immediate tax year and applied to the next years statewide cap; and</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;The Tax Commission shall publish the percentage of the contribution which may be claimed as a credit by contributors for the most recently completed calendar year on the Tax Commission website no later than February 15 of each calendar year for contributions made the previous year. &nbsp;Each organization authorized pursuant to subsections B, C, and D of this section shall notify contributors of that amount annually.</p>

<p>J. &nbsp;No tax credits authorized by this section shall be used to reduce the tax liability of the taxpayer to less than zero (0).</p>

<p>K. &nbsp;Any credits authorized by this section allowed but not used in any tax year may be carried over, in order, to each of the three (3) years following the year of qualification.</p>

<p>L. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;In order to qualify under this section, each organization authorized pursuant to subsections C and D of this section shall submit an application with information to the Oklahoma Tax Commission on a form prescribed by the Tax Commission that:</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;describes the proposed innovative educational program or programs supported by the organization.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;The Tax Commission shall review and approve or disapprove the application, in consultation with the State Department of Education.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;In order to maintain eligibility under this section, an organization authorized pursuant to subsections C and D of this section shall annually report the following information to the Tax Commission and publish on its website by September 1 of each year:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;the name of the innovative educational program or programs and the total amount of the grant or grants made to those programs during the immediately preceding school year,</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;the total number and total dollar amount of educational scholarships awarded and funded during the previous academic year,</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;the total number, total dollar amount, and percentage of educational scholarships awarded and funded during the previous academic year disaggregated into the following categories:</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;the percentage of annual revenue received by the organization from donations which qualify for tax credits pursuant to this section which was not expended on scholarships,</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;disaggregated data reported under this subsection shall be redacted if reporting would allow for identification of specific children, and shall be reported in accordance with the Student Data Accessibility, Transparency and Accountability Act of 2013, division b of subparagraph 2 of subsection C of Section 3-168 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), 20 U.S.C., Section 1232g, and</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;A scholarship-granting organization shall annually submit verification to the Tax Commission that the organization still meets the criteria set forth in paragraph 7 of subsection H of this section.</p>

<p>N. &nbsp;Contributions made pursuant to subsections B, C, and D of this section shall not be used by the Legislature to reduce the amount appropriated for the financial support of public schools.</p>
