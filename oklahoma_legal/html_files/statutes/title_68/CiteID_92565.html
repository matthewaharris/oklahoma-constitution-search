Any payer who fails to withhold or pay to the Tax Commission any sums herein required to be withheld or paid shall be personally and individually liable therefor to the State of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>H. Corporations. For all taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, a tax is hereby imposed upon the Oklahoma taxable income of every corporation doing business within this state or deriving income from sources within this state in an amount equal to four percent (4%) thereof.</p>

<p>There shall be no additional Oklahoma income tax imposed on accumulated taxable income or on undistributed personal holding company income as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</p>

<p>I. Certain foreign corporations. In lieu of the tax imposed in the first paragraph of subsection G of this section, for all taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, there shall be imposed on foreign corporations, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a tax of four percent (4%) instead of thirty percent (30%) as used in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, where such income is received from sources within this state, in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Oklahoma Income Tax Act.</p>

<p>Every payer of amounts covered by this subsection shall deduct and withhold from such amounts paid each payee an amount equal to four percent (4%) thereof. Every payer required to deduct and withhold taxes under this subsection shall for each quarterly period on or before the last day of the month following the close of each such quarterly period, pay over the amount so withheld as taxes to the Tax Commission, and shall file a return with each such payment.
