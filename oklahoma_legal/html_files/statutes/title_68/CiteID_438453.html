<p>Definitions.</p>

<p>As used in the Oklahoma Sales Tax Code:</p>

<p>1. Alcoholic beverages means beverages that are suitable for human consumption and contain one-half of one percent (0.5%) or more of alcohol by volume;</p>

<p>2. Bottled water means water that is placed in a safety sealed container or package for human consumption. Bottled water is calorie-free and does not contain sweeteners or other additives except that it may contain:</p>

<p>a. antimicrobial agents,</p>

<p>b. fluoride,</p>

<p>c. carbonation,</p>

<p>d. vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes,</p>

<p>e. oxygen,</p>

<p>f. preservatives, and</p>

<p>g. only those flavors, extracts, or essences derived from a spice or fruit;</p>

<p>3. Bundled transaction means the retail sale of two or more products, except real property and services to real property, where the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, and the products are sold for one nonitemized price. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. As used in this paragraph:</p>

<p>a. distinct and identifiable products does not include:</p>

<p>(1) packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles, or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides, that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale thereof, including but not limited to, grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags and express delivery envelopes and boxes,</p>

<p>(2) a product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge, or</p>

<p>(3) items included in the definition of gross receipts or sales price, pursuant to this section,</p>

<p>b. one nonitemized price does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form including, but not limited to, an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list.</p>

<p>A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction shall not be considered a bundled transaction if it is:</p>

<p>(1) the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service,</p>

<p>(2) the retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service,</p>

<p>(3) a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis. For purposes of this subdivision, de minimis means the sellers purchase price or sales price of taxable products is ten percent (10%) or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Sellers shall use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers shall use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis, or</p>

<p>(4) the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where:</p>

<p>(a) the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices or medical supplies, and</p>

<p>(b) the sellers purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is fifty percent (50%) or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the fifty percent (50%) determination for a transaction;</p>

<p>4. Business means any activity engaged in or caused to be engaged in by any person with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage, either direct or indirect;</p>

<p>8. Computer software means a set of coded instructions designed to cause a computer or automatic data processing equipment to perform a task;</p>

<p>9. Consumer or user means a person to whom a taxable sale of tangible personal property is made or to whom a taxable service is furnished. Consumer or user includes all contractors to whom a taxable sale of materials, supplies, equipment, or other tangible personal property is made or to whom a taxable service is furnished to be used or consumed in the performance of any contract;</p>

If a food item has four or more servings packaged as one food item sold for a single price, the seller must give or hand eating utensils to the purchaser. Serving sizes must be determined based on a label on an item sold, or if no label is available, then a seller shall determine the reasonable number of servings in an item, or</p>

<p>(2) the cost of materials used, labor or service cost,</p>

<p>(3) interest, losses, all costs of transportation to the seller, all taxes imposed on the seller, and any other expense of the seller,</p>

<p>(4) charges by the seller for any services necessary to complete the sale, other than delivery and installation charges,</p>

<p>b. Such term shall not include:</p>

<p>(1) discounts, including cash, term, or coupons that are not reimbursed by a third party that are allowed by a seller and taken by a purchaser on a sale,</p>

<p>(2) interest, financing, and carrying charges from credit extended on the sale of personal property or services, if the amount is separately stated on the invoice, bill of sale or similar document given to the purchaser, and</p>

<p>(3) any taxes legally imposed directly on the consumer that are separately stated on the invoice, bill of sale or similar document given to the purchaser.</p>

<p>(b) the purchaser identifies himself or herself to the seller as a member of a group or organization entitled to a price reduction or discount; provided, a preferred customer card that is available to any patron does not constitute membership in such a group, or</p>

<p>(c) the price reduction or discount is identified as a third-party price reduction or discount on the invoice received by the purchaser or on a coupon, certificate or other documentation presented by the purchaser;</p>

<p>19. a. Maintaining a place of business in this state means and shall be presumed to include:</p>

<p>(b) having agents operating in this state, whether the place of business or agent is within this state temporarily or permanently or whether the person or agent is authorized to do business within this state, and</p>

<p>c. Any ruling, agreement or contract, whether written or oral, express or implied, between a person and executive branch of this state, or any other state agency or department, stating, agreeing or ruling that the person is not maintaining a place of business in this state or is not required to collect sales and use tax in this state despite the presence of a warehouse, distribution center or fulfillment center in this state that is owned or operated by the vendor or an affiliated person of the vendor shall be null and void unless it is specifically approved by a majority vote of each house of the Legislature;</p>

<p>21. Manufacturing operation means the designing, manufacturing, compounding, processing, assembling, warehousing, or preparing of articles for sale as tangible personal property. A manufacturing operation begins at the point where the materials enter the manufacturing site and ends at the point where a finished product leaves the manufacturing site. Manufacturing operation does not include administration, sales, distribution, transportation, site construction, or site maintenance. Extractive activities and field processes shall not be deemed to be a part of a manufacturing operation even when performed by a person otherwise engaged in manufacturing;</p>

<p>27. Prewritten computer software means computer software, including prewritten upgrades, which is not designed and developed by the author or other creator to the specifications of a specific purchaser.
