<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. For tax years beginning after December 31, 1999, 
and ending before January 1, 2006, there shall be allowed to an investor making 
an eligible investment a credit against the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this 
title or Section 624 or 628 of Title 36 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The credit may 
be used in the payment of estimated tax payments for the tax imposed by Section 
624 or 628 of Title 36 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The credit shall be in the 
amount as set forth in subsection F or subsection G of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The amount of the credit shall be freely 
transferable to subsequent transferees.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. As used in this section:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. "Capitalization commitment" means a commitment by 
a local governmental entity or the beneficiary thereof or a private entity, 
whether by contract, letter agreement, terms sheet, resolution, ordinance or 
indenture, to provide funds, personal property or real property. "Capitalization 
commitment" shall also mean, in circumstances limited to local governmental 
entities or the beneficiaries thereof, a moral obligation to provide future 
funds, personal property or real property. To provide funds, personal property 
or real property shall include but not be limited to providing funds, personal 
property or real property in the form of security or collateral to a financial 
lending institution in support of a revenue bond, financial obligation or other 
evidence of indebtedness issued by a local governmental entity;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. "Consideration" means, but is not limited to, 
funds, personal property or real property and a capitalization commitment. The 
source of the funds or other consideration for the investment by one or more 
investors, whether borrowed or otherwise, is irrelevant to the determination of 
investment. The fact that the source of funds is from a financial lending 
institution is also irrelevant;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. "Eligible investment" means an investment made 
during a period not earlier than January 1, 1999, and not later than December 
31, 2002, in an establishment that:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. is headquartered in this state or is ultimately 
controlled by an entity headquartered in this state, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. has been certified by the Tax Commission as 
meeting the following minimum qualifications:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) is included within the definition of "basic 
industry" as set forth in division (7) of subparagraph a of paragraph 1 of 
subsection A of Section 3603 of this title and has been preapproved by the 
Oklahoma Department of Commerce to receive incentive payments pursuant to the 
Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act. The Department shall establish a process for 
preapproval of applicants for the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act for purposes 
of this division. The establishment shall agree to submit such information as 
may be required under this section and the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act to 
allow the Tax Commission to determine the amount of the tax credit allowed 
pursuant to the provisions of this section and the amount of incentive payments 
allowed pursuant to the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act for purposes of 
subsection K of this section,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) can demonstrate commitments from not fewer than 
twenty entities doing business in this state, with such entities having in the 
aggregate not fewer than two thousand (2,000) employees in this state, to 
utilize the services of the establishment in providing nonstop air 
transportation from this state to either the west coast or the east coast of the 
continental United States, or both. Such commitments, at a minimum, may be in 
the form of letters of intent from authorized officers of such entities which 
demonstrate a best efforts intention to utilize such air transportation, 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) has received, or its parent has received, in 
calendar year 2000, a capitalization commitment in the amount of Fifteen Million 
Dollars ($15,000,000.00) or more from a local governmental entity, including, 
but not limited to, proceeds from the issuance of revenue bonds, financial 
obligations or other evidences of indebtedness. For purposes of this section and 
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5063.4 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes or any other laws to the contrary, credit enhancement by the Oklahoma 
Development Finance Authority through the Oklahoma Credit Enhancement Reserve 
Fund up to a maximum of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) is hereby 
authorized, subject to the approval of the Executive and Legislative Bond 
Oversight Commissions pursuant to Section 695.8 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The tax credit provided for in this section shall not 
be allowed or, if already claimed, shall be subject to recapture as to the 
initial investor or investors, with respect to any amount of an eligible 
investment made which is subsequently refunded or returned to any such investor. 
Any such recapture shall only apply as to that part of the tax credit as is 
associated with the investment refunded or returned.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude an 
establishment from utilizing a wholly owned operating subsidiary to perform its 
flight and related operations to meet the requirements of this 
subsection;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. "Financial lending institution" means a bank, 
credit union, savings and loan association, commercial finance company, 
governmental agency, including a local governmental entity, or other entity 
principally engaged in investment, finance or the extension of 
credit;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. "Investment" means:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. consideration in exchange for "equity and 
near-equity", which means common stock, preferred stock, warrants or other 
rights to subscribe to stock or its equivalent, or an interest in a partnership, 
or debt that is convertible into or entitles the holder to receive upon its 
exercise, common stock, preferred stock, royalty interest, or an interest in a 
partnership,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. consideration in exchange for "subordinated debt", 
which means indebtedness that is subordinated to other indebtedness of the 
issuer that has been issued or is to be issued by a financial lending 
institution, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. in the event of a capitalization commitment in 
accordance with the provisions of division (3) of subparagraph b of paragraph 3 
of this subsection, where a local governmental entity is issuing revenue bonds, 
financial obligations or other evidences of indebtedness, the receipt of the 
proceeds of revenue bonds, financial obligations or other evidences of 
indebtedness issued by a local governmental entity by a parent and the 
subsequent transfer of such proceeds to a subsidiary.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Actions of the establishment to use such investment 
as security for indebtedness, even as security for that of another party, or 
other uses, in compliance with loan covenants as may be part of the issuance of 
revenue bonds, financial obligations or other evidences of indebtedness, shall 
not affect its determination as investment. For purposes of this section, 
investment in an establishment which has, prior to February 1, 2002, been 
certified as an eligible establishment by the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be 
treated as an eligible investment in such establishment for the purposes of this 
section with respect to investment made at any time prior to December 31, 
2002;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. "Investor" means one or more persons or entities 
making an investment and may include one or more persons or entities which 
wholly or partially own the establishment;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. "Local governmental entity" includes, but is not 
limited to, a county, municipality or public authority or trust created pursuant 
to the provisions of Title 60 of the Oklahoma Statutes of which the state or a 
county or municipality or combination thereof, is a beneficiary, or a state 
public authority or trust;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. "Parent" means an entity owning fifty-one percent 
(51%) or more of the establishment and providing fifty-one percent (51%) or more 
of the investment in the establishment; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. "Subsequently refunded or returned", when used in 
reference to an eligible investment, means an actual redemption by the 
establishment of the securities or other indicia of ownership in the 
establishment received by the investor from the investors investment. The 
failure to allow the tax credits or the recapture of the tax credits shall not 
affect the validity of the tax credits in the hands of a transferee of the 
initial investor or subsequent transferees. Provided, an investor to whom an 
eligible investment, or portion thereof, is subsequently refunded or returned 
shall reimburse the Tax Commission the amount of any credits claimed by a 
transferee with respect to any such amount.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Certify, upon request of an authorized agent or 
representative of an establishment described by paragraph 3 of subsection C of 
this section, that the establishment for which the certification is sought meets 
the qualifications prescribed by subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 3 of 
subsection C of this section. The certification shall be in writing and signed 
by an authorized representative of the Tax Commission and, for purposes of 
determining qualifications of an establishment in which an investment may be 
eligible for the credit authorized by this section, shall be binding upon the 
Tax Commission; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Issue a certificate to an investor that provides 
adequate documentation of qualification for the credit authorized by this 
section even if the credit may not be claimed until after the date upon which 
the certificate is requested. Upon issuance, the certificate shall be evidence 
that an investor or a transferee of the original tax credit claimant submitting 
the certificate, or a certified copy thereof, with the relevant tax return or 
other form, has the legal right to exercise the credit in order to reduce the 
relevant tax liability for the period authorized by this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. Except as otherwise provided by subsection G of 
this section, the maximum amount of all eligible investments for which tax 
credits may be claimed under this section shall be Thirty Million Dollars 
($30,000,000.00). If more than one establishment has been certified by the Tax 
Commission pursuant to the provisions of subsection D of this section, the 
investors in the first such approved establishment shall be entitled to a credit 
based on their investment of the lesser of their eligible investment or Thirty 
Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00). The investors in the second such approved 
establishment shall then be entitled to a credit based on their investment of 
the lesser of their eligible investment or the difference between the total 
eligible investments in previously approved establishments and Thirty Million 
Dollars ($30,000,000.00). This same procedure will apply for all subsequently 
approved establishments. If the amount of eligible investments exceeds the 
amount upon which the tax credit may be claimed as provided herein, investors 
shall be allowed a share of the amount of the available tax credit in order of 
the dates of receipt of certification therefor by the Tax Commission pursuant to 
the provisions of paragraph 1 of subsection D of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Except as otherwise provided by subsection G of 
this section, the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to the provisions of 
subsection A of this section shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of the 
investment and shall be fully redeemable as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. An investor or investors in an establishment that 
has been approved for eligible investment before February 1, 2002, pursuant to 
this section may receive tax credits for additional eligible investment in such 
establishment during the period February 1, 2002, to December 31, 2002. The 
maximum amount of such additional tax credits shall be Nine Million Dollars 
($9,000,000.00) with One Dollar ($1.00) of tax credit for each dollar of 
eligible investment. The tax credits authorized by this subsection may not be 
used as to any tax obligation that is due and payable before July 1, 2003. For 
the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2003, and the fiscal years that begin July 
1, 2004, and July 1, 2005, the amount of tax credits authorized by this 
subsection which may be used during each such fiscal year shall not exceed Three 
Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. The amount of a tax credit allowed pursuant to the 
provisions of this section not used in payment of taxes due in the year in which 
such credit is allowed pursuant to subsection F or subsection G of this section 
may be used as a credit against subsequent tax liability of the investor or a 
subsequent transferee for a period not to exceed three (3) years from the year 
in which such credit is originally allowed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. The Tax Commission shall develop and issue 
appropriate forms and instructions to enable investors to claim the tax credit 
provided for in this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. An establishment in which an eligible investment 
qualifies for a credit authorized by this section shall maintain a record of 
investment made in the establishment for the period beginning January 1, 1999, 
and ending December 31, 2002. The establishment shall notify the Tax Commission 
not later than January 31, 2003, of the total investment amount for such period. 
Any such establishment which refunds or returns any amount of an eligible 
investment to the investor shall notify the Tax Commission in writing of the 
amount and recipient of such refunds or returns. The Tax Commission shall 
compute the maximum amount of credits available pursuant to this section based 
upon notification of the investment amount transmitted to the Tax Commission by 
the establishment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. An establishment in which eligible investments 
qualify for the tax credit authorized by this section shall not receive 
incentive payments pursuant to the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act until the 
total of such incentive payments the establishment would otherwise receive 
exceeds the total amount of the credit authorized by this section as computed by 
the Tax Commission pursuant to subsection J of this section. The amount of 
incentive payments for any year which would otherwise be paid to the 
establishment shall be distributed as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. If the amount of such incentive payments equals or 
exceeds the amount of the tax credit for the year, the amount of such payments 
which is equal to the amount of the tax credit shall be apportioned as if 
collected from the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title or Section 624 or 
628 of Title 36 of the Oklahoma Statutes according to which tax the credit was 
claimed against. The amount of such payments which is in excess of the amount of 
the tax credit shall be retained by the Tax Commission to be paid as provided 
for in this paragraph for subsequent years for which the tax credit is allowed 
to the establishment;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If the amount of such incentive payments and any 
amount retained by the Tax Commission pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 
of this subsection is less than the amount of the tax credit for the year, 
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1727 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes, the Tax Commission shall withhold a portion of the taxes levied and 
collected pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 
500.4 of this title which would otherwise be paid over to the Department of 
Transportation by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of Section 1730 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes equal to the amount of the deficit. The Tax Commission shall apportion
