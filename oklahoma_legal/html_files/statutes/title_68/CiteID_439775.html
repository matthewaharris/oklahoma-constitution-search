<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>&nbsp;A. All penalties, interest and forfeitures which may accrue on delinquent ad valorem taxes, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, on any properties, persons, firms or corporations within any county, city, town or school district within a county; the proceeds of sale of property acquired by the county at resale, the proceeds of leases, rentals and other royalties arising from the management, control and operation by the county commissioners of property acquired by the county at resale, when collected shall be credited to and accounted for in a special cash fund to be styled the "resale property fund" of such county, except the proceeds of sale of such property located in any special improvement district and by the resale of which any special improvement taxes were canceled, in which event the proceeds of sale thereof after having been acquired by the county shall be divided ratably between the resale property fund and the special improvement-tax account (paving, etc.) of the special improvement district in which such property is located, in the same ratio as the ad valorem tax bears to the special improvement taxes in the total amount of such taxes published as due at the time of the resale whereby the county acquired title to such property. That portion so accruing to such special improvement-tax account shall, in keeping with the statutes relating thereto, be applied to the fund provided for retirement of bonds and interest coupons of such improvement district.</p>

<p>B. The resale property fund herein created for each county is hereby declared to be a continuous fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations, and is hereby dedicated, insofar as may be necessary, to the enforcement of the tax laws of the state, and is authorized to be expended for the following purposes:</p>

<p>1. For the purchase of necessary records, printing, supplies and equipment, and the employment of necessary clerical personnel, either on whole or part-time basis, in connection with delinquent personal tax lists and personal tax warrants, delinquent real estate tax lists and lists of unredeemed delinquent real estate subject to tax sale or resale, such costs to be limited to those incurred by the county treasurer;</p>

<p>2. For payment of the cost of advertising or publication, or posting if publication cannot be had, of any such lists;</p>

<p>3. For the reimbursement of the purchaser at resale or at commissioners' sale of any lot, tract, or parcel of real estate, sold at resale, against which no tax was due, or where the inclusion of such lot, tract, or parcel in the publication and offer for resale has been held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, or where the title thereto is vested in the Commissioners of the Land Office of the State of Oklahoma, or where such Commissioners of the Land Office have instituted or successfully terminated mortgage foreclosure proceedings in relation thereto prior to issuance of either a resale tax deed or a county commissioners' deed, or where such tract or parcel was nontaxable at the time of the assessment thereof for taxes, or where the sale thereof to such purchaser was illegal for any other reason; and such purchaser has no adequate recourse against the property thus sold; such reimbursement shall be made in the order of the claims filed with the county treasurer therefore, when properly supported by evidence satisfactory to said treasurer that the claimant is entitled to reimbursement hereunder. Provided, however, that no claim for refund not filed, as herein provided, within a period of three (3) years from the date of such sale shall be allowed or paid from said fund;</p>

<p>4. For all rebates allowed under authority of statute by the board of county commissioners or the tax roll correction board of the county upon taxes found to have been illegally or erroneously collected, or on sale of certificate or issue of tax deed on lands or lots on which no tax was due or as to which the sale thereof is or was illegal for any reason. Provided, however, before the owner of such invalid deed may be reimbursed as aforesaid, he shall first be required to divest himself of purported title by attaching a quitclaim deed or other disclaimer to his claim for refund, setting out the reason for invalidity of the tax deed. The same procedure for refund shall apply whether the tax deed be from the county treasurer or the chairman of the board of county commissioners. The determination of whether such property has been erroneously sold for taxes to such purchaser, shall be made by the board of county commissioners; and in event title under an invalid resale tax deed remains with the county commissioners, the board of county commissioners so finding same invalid shall execute its resolution or order of disclaimer which shall be filed in the deed records of the county clerk without fee. No fee shall be charged for recording any quitclaim deed or disclaimer from the purchaser under the provisions of this section; and</p>

<p>5. To pay general operating expenses for the county treasurer's office.</p>

<p>C. The expenditures so made shall be made only upon sworn itemized claims approved by the county treasurer and filed with the county clerk and paid by cash voucher drawn by the county clerk payable from said fund. Claims for cost of publication shall take precedence over all other claims on said fund, otherwise said approved claims shall be paid in the order filed as funds accrue from sale of county property as hereinbefore provided. If any such claim has not been paid within three (3) years, the same shall cease to be an obligation of the resale property fund of such county; but nothing in this article shall operate to prevent the payment for such services from an appropriation for such purpose in the general fund of the county in the manner and under the restrictions provided by law.</p>

<p>D. Any residue of cash actually on hand in said fund at any time, after providing for the expense of delinquent tax publication, and for the mandatory holding of sales and resales, made or about to be made, the purchase of necessary records, printing and supplies and the payment of clerical hire, such expenditures, or reserve therefor, to be limited to the necessary expenses incurred by virtue of the authorization herein granted, may be expended by the county commissioners, without further appropriation, in the upkeep, repair and maintenance of unsold properties acquired by the county at resale, by the issuance of cash warrants on such fund in payment of sworn itemized claims therefor; limited in amount to the sum certified to by the county treasurer as being actually on hand in excess of the amount reserved for the purposes hereinbefore stated.</p>

<p>E. On or before the 30th of June of each year the county treasurer shall file a financial statement of the resale property fund with the county clerk for the approval of the board of county commissioners, setting forth the necessary reserves for expenditures either made or anticipated, to cover:</p>

<p>1. The cost of preparing and making delinquent tax publications, as hereinbefore set out;</p>

<p>2. The purchase of necessary records, printing and supplies and the payment of clerical hire, such reserves therefor, to be limited to the necessary expenses incurred by virtue of the authorization herein granted;</p>

<p>3. To pay claims and encumbrances for the upkeep, repair and maintenance of unsold properties;</p>

<p>4. To pay all rebates allowed under authority of statute by the board of county commissioners or the board of tax roll corrections upon taxes found to have been illegally or erroneously collected;</p>

<p>5. To pay for tax sale certificates or issue of deeds on lands or lots on which no tax was due or as to which the sale thereof was illegal for any reason; and</p>

<p>6. To pay general operating expenses for the county treasurer's office.</p>

<p>F. Any balance remaining on hand over and above the necessary reserves for the above mentioned items shall be apportioned forthwith by the county treasurer in the following manner:</p>

<p>1. In each county having a net assessed valuation in excess of Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000.00):</p>

<p>a. one-third (1/3) of such surplus residue to such county to be applied first to the payment of delinquent warrants of such county, thereafter to its current general fund,</p>

<p>b. one-third (1/3) to the cities and towns of such county, in the ratio that the last certified assessed valuation of each bears to the total such assessed valuation of all such cities and towns in such county, to be by each of them applied in the payment of any delinquent warrants of such city or town, thereafter to its current general fund, and</p>

<p>c. one-third (1/3) to the various school districts of the county on a scholastic enumeration basis, to be applied by each of them to the payment of any delinquent warrants of such district and thereafter to its current general fund.</p>

<p>2. In each county having a net assessed valuation of Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000.00) or less:</p>

<p>a. In the ratio that the county, city or town and school district levy bears to the fifteen-mill levy as allocated by the county excise board.</p>

<p>b. Such surplus to the cities and towns of such county in the ratio that the last certified assessed valuation of each bears to the total assessed valuation of all such cities or towns in such county.</p>

<p>c. Such surplus to the school districts of the county on a scholastic enumeration basis.</p>

<p>d. The amounts apportioned to each county, city or town and school district shall be applied by each of them to the payment of any delinquent warrants of such municipality and thereafter to its current general fund.</p>

<p>G. Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal, amend, alter or modify any of the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92760">Sections 2479 </a>or <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92762">2480</a> of this article, but shall be construed to be cumulative thereto.</p>
