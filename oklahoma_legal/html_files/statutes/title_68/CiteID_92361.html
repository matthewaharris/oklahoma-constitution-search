<p>1. Sales of goods, wares, merchandise, tangible personal property, machinery and equipment to a manufacturer for use in a manufacturing operation. Goods, wares, merchandise, property, machinery and equipment used in a nonmanufacturing activity or process as set forth in paragraph 14 of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438453">Section 1352</a> of this title shall not be eligible for the exemption provided for in this subsection by virtue of the activity or process being performed in conjunction with or integrated into a manufacturing operation.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this paragraph, sales made to any person, firm or entity that has entered into a contractual relationship for the construction and improvement of manufacturing goods, wares, merchandise, property, machinery and equipment for use in a manufacturing operation shall be considered sales made to a manufacturer which is defined or classified in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Manual under Industry Group No. 324110. Such purchase shall be evidenced by a copy of the sales ticket or invoice to be retained by the vendor indicating that the purchases are made for and on behalf of such manufacturer and set out the name of such manufacturer as well as include a copy of the Manufacturing Exemption Permit of the manufacturer. Any person who wrongfully or erroneously certifies that purchases are being made on behalf of such manufacturer or who otherwise violates this paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined an amount equal to double the amount of sales tax involved or incarcerated for not more than sixty (60) days or both;</p>

<p>2. Ethyl alcohol when sold and used for the purpose of blending same with motor fuel on which motor fuel tax is levied by Section 500.4 of this title;</p>

<p>3. Sales of containers when sold to a person regularly engaged in the business of reselling empty or filled containers or when purchased for the purpose of packaging raw products of farm, garden, or orchard for resale to the consumer or processor. This exemption shall not apply to the sale of any containers used more than once and which are ordinarily known as returnable containers, except returnable soft drink bottles and the cartons, crates, pallets, and containers used to transport returnable soft drink bottles. Each and every transfer of title or possession of such returnable containers in this state to any person who is not regularly engaged in the business of selling, reselling or otherwise transferring empty or filled containers shall be taxable under this Code. Additionally, this exemption shall not apply to the sale of labels or other materials delivered along with items sold but which are not necessary or absolutely essential to the sale of the sold merchandise;</p>

<p>4.

<p>5. Sale of tangible personal property when sold by the manufacturer to a person who transports it to a state other than Oklahoma for immediate and exclusive use in a state other than Oklahoma. Provided, no sales at a retail outlet shall qualify for the exemption under this paragraph;</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, sales made to a contractor or subcontractor that has previously entered into a contractual relationship with a qualified manufacturer or distributor for construction or expansion of a manufacturing or distribution facility shall be considered sales made to a qualified manufacturer or distributor. For the purposes of this paragraph, "qualified manufacturer or distributor" means:</p>

<p>a. any manufacturing enterprise whose total cost of construction of a new or expanded facility exceeds the sum of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) and in which at least one hundred (100) new full-time-equivalent employees, as certified by the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, are added and maintained for a period of at least thirty-six (36) months as a direct result of the new or expanded facility,</p>
