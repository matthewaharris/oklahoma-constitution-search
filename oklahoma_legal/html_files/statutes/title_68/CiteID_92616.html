<p><strong>Version 1 (Amended by Laws 2024, HB 3388, c. 277, § 2, emerg. eff. May 6, 2024)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>For all tax years beginning after December 31, 1981, taxable income and adjusted gross income shall be adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income and Oklahoma adjusted gross income as required by this section.</p>

<p>A. The taxable income of any taxpayer shall be adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income for corporations and Oklahoma adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:</p>

<p>1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross income.</p>

<p>2. There shall be deducted amounts included in such income that the state is prohibited from taxing because of the provisions of the Federal Constitution, the State Constitution, federal laws or laws of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall be adjusted as follows:</p>

<p>a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss from sources within this state, as determined pursuant to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of the total loss for such year;</p>

<p>b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the Oklahoma net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to such year. Oklahoma net operating losses shall be separately determined by reference to Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, as modified by the Oklahoma Income Tax Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, and shall be allowed without regard to the existence of a federal net operating loss. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2000, and ending before January 1, 2008, the years to which such losses may be carried shall be determined solely by reference to Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, with the exception that the terms net operating loss and taxable income shall be replaced with Oklahoma net operating loss and Oklahoma taxable income. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, and ending before January 1, 2009, years to which such losses may be carried back shall be limited to two (2) years. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, the years to which such losses may be carried back shall be determined solely by reference to Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, with the exception that the terms net operating loss and taxable income shall be replaced with Oklahoma net operating loss and Oklahoma taxable income.</p>

<p>4. Items of the following nature shall be allocated as indicated. Allowable deductions attributable to items separately allocable in subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph, whether or not such items of income were actually received, shall be allocated on the same basis as those items:</p>

<p>a. Income from real and tangible personal property, such as rents, oil and mining production or royalties, and gains or losses from sales of such property, shall be allocated in accordance with the situs of such property;</p>

<p>b. Income from intangible personal property, such as interest, dividends, patent or copyright royalties, and gains or losses from sales of such property, shall be allocated in accordance with the domiciliary situs of the taxpayer, except that:</p>

<p>(1) where such property has acquired a nonunitary business or commercial situs apart from the domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be allocated in accordance with such business or commercial situs; interest income from investments held to generate working capital for a unitary business enterprise shall be included in apportionable income; a resident trust or resident estate shall be treated as having a separate commercial or business situs insofar as undistributed income is concerned, but shall not be treated as having a separate commercial or business situs insofar as distributed income is concerned,</p>

<p>(2) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of the original cost of such partnerships tangible property in this state to the original cost of such partnerships tangible property everywhere, as determined at the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the partnerships assets consists of intangible assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in the partnership shall be allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full tax period immediately preceding its tax period during which the ownership interest in the partnership was sold; the provisions of this division shall only apply if the capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in a partnership do not constitute qualifying gain receiving capital treatment as defined in subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section,</p>

<p>(3) income from such property which is required to be allocated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this subsection shall be allocated as herein provided;</p>

<p>c. Net income or loss from a business activity which is not a part of business carried on within or without the state of a unitary character shall be separately allocated to the state in which such activity is conducted;</p>

<p>d. In the case of a manufacturing or processing enterprise the business of which in this state consists solely of marketing its products by:</p>

<p>(1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped directly to a point from without the state to a purchaser within the state, commonly known as interstate sales,</p>

<p>(2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses within the state pursuant to in transit tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser within the state,</p>

<p>(3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses within the state where the shipment to such warehouses is not covered by in transit tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser within or without the state,</p>

<p>the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived from the manufacture and/or processing and sales everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales defined in this section made to the purchaser within the state to the total sales everywhere. The term public warehouse as used in this subparagraph means a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of which is warehousing merchandise for the public;</p>

<p>e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:</p>

<p>(1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance company for a taxable year shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying such income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state, and the denominator of which is the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks everywhere. For purposes of this subsection, the term direct premiums written means the total amount of direct premiums written, assessments and annuity considerations as reported for the taxable year on the annual statement filed by the company with the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or such other form as may be prescribed in lieu thereof,</p>

<p>(2) if the principal source of premiums written by an insurance company consists of premiums for reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of such company shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying such income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks in this state, and the denominator of which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks everywhere, plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph, premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks in this state, whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the election of the company be determined on the basis of the proportion which premiums written for insurance accepted from companies commercially domiciled in this state bears to premiums written for reinsurance accepted from all sources, or alternatively in the proportion which the sum of the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state by each ceding company from which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of the total direct premiums written by each such ceding company for the taxable year.</p>

<p>5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity, the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection, including the sale or other disposition of such property and any other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment factors shall be computed as follows:</p>

<p>a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayers real and tangible personal property everywhere owned or rented and used during the tax period.</p>

<p>(1) Property, the income from which is separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection, shall not be included in determining this fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of the investment in transportation and other equipment having no fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks and trailers, including machinery and equipment carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons automobiles and other similar equipment, in the proportion that miles traveled in this state by such equipment bears to total miles traveled,</p>

<p>(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals,</p>

<p>(3) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax Commission may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayers property;</p>

<p>b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total compensation for services rendered in the state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total compensation for services rendered everywhere during the tax period. Compensation, as used in this subsection, means those paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary business but does not include officers salaries, wages and other compensation.</p>

<p>(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of such expenditure in connection with employees operating equipment over a fixed route, such as railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus drivers, in this state only a part of the time, in the proportion that mileage traveled in this state bears to total mileage traveled by such employees,</p>

<p>(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of such expenditures in connection with itinerant employees, such as traveling salespersons, in this state only a part of the time, in the proportion that time spent in this state bears to total time spent in furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;</p>

<p>c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Sales, as used in this subsection, does not include sales or gross revenue which are separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection.</p>

<p>(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs in this state if the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser other than the United States government, within this state regardless of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale; or the property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory or other place of storage in this state and (a) the purchaser is the United States government or (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the state of the destination of the shipment.</p>

<p>(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall not be less than the allocation of revenues to this state as shown in its annual report to the Corporation Commission.</p>

<p>(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of revenue from interstate transportation in the proportion that interstate mileage traveled in this state bears to total interstate mileage traveled.</p>

<p>(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall be either the total of traffic units of the enterprise within this state or the revenue allocated to this state based upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator of which shall be the total of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A traffic unit is hereby defined as the transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case may be.</p>

<p>(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other communication enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include that portion of the interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to the accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission; provided that in respect to each corporation or business entity required by the Federal Communications Commission to keep its books and records in accordance with a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such Commission, the intrastate net income shall be determined separately in the manner provided by such uniform system of accounts and only the interstate income shall be subject to allocation pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Provided further, that the gross revenue factors shall be those as are determined pursuant to the accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

<p>In any case where the apportionment of the three factors prescribed in this paragraph attributes to this state a portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been attributed to this state, or require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to this state, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income attributable to this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise must attribute to this state only a reasonable portion thereof.</p>

<p>6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999, and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which the investment was originally made.</p>

<p>For purposes of this paragraph:</p>

<p>a. Agricultural commodity processing facility means buildings, structures, fixtures and improvements used or operated primarily for the processing or production of marketable products from agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not include a facility that provides only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation of agricultural commodities, and</p>

<p>b. Facility means each part of the facility which is used in a process primarily for:</p>

<p>(1) the processing of agricultural commodities, including receiving or storing agricultural commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy operation,</p>

<p>(2) transporting the agricultural commodities or product before, during or after the processing, or</p>

<hr />
<p>For all tax years beginning after December 31, 1981, taxable income and adjusted gross income shall be adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income and Oklahoma adjusted gross income as required by this section.</p>

<p>A. The taxable income of any taxpayer shall be adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income for corporations and Oklahoma adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:</p>

<p>1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross income.</p>

<p>a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss from sources within this state, as determined pursuant to this section and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92623">Section 2362</a> of this title, for the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of the total loss for such year;</p>

<p>b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the Oklahoma net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to such year. Oklahoma net operating losses shall be separately determined by reference to Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, as modified by the Oklahoma Income Tax Act, <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92560">Section 2351</a> et seq. of this title, and shall be allowed without regard to the existence of a federal net operating loss. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2000, and ending before January 1, 2008, the years to which such losses may be carried shall be determined solely by reference to Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, with the exception that the terms net operating loss and taxable income shall be replaced with Oklahoma net operating loss and Oklahoma taxable income. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, and ending before January 1, 2009, years to which such losses may be carried back shall be limited to two (2) years.

<p>4. Items of the following nature shall be allocated as indicated. Allowable deductions attributable to items separately allocable in subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph, whether or not such items of income were actually received, shall be allocated on the same basis as those items:</p>

<p>b. Income from intangible personal property, such as interest, dividends, patent or copyright royalties, and gains or losses from sales of such property, shall be allocated in accordance with the domiciliary situs of the taxpayer, except that:</p>

<p>(1) where such property has acquired a nonunitary business or commercial situs apart from the domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be allocated in accordance with such business or commercial situs; interest income from investments held to generate working capital for a unitary business enterprise shall be included in apportionable income; a resident trust or resident estate shall be treated as having a separate commercial or business situs insofar as undistributed income is concerned, but shall not be treated as having a separate commercial or business situs insofar as distributed income is concerned,</p>

<p>(2) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of the original cost of such partnerships tangible property in this state to the original cost of such partnerships tangible property everywhere, as determined at the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the partnerships assets consists of intangible assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in the partnership shall be allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full tax period immediately preceding its tax period during which the ownership interest in the partnership was sold; the provisions of this division shall only apply if the capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in a partnership do not constitute qualifying gain receiving capital treatment as defined in subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section,</p>

<p>(3) income from such property which is required to be allocated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this subsection shall be allocated as herein provided;</p>

<p>c. Net income or loss from a business activity which is not a part of business carried on within or without the state of a unitary character shall be separately allocated to the state in which such activity is conducted;</p>

The term public warehouse as used in this subparagraph means a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of which is warehousing merchandise for the public;</p>

<p>e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:</p>

<p>(1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance company for a taxable year shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying such income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state, and the denominator of which is the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks everywhere. For purposes of this subsection, the term direct premiums written means the total amount of direct premiums written, assessments and annuity considerations as reported for the taxable year on the annual statement filed by the company with the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or such other form as may be prescribed in lieu thereof,</p>

<p>(2) if the principal source of premiums written by an insurance company consists of premiums for reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of such company shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying such income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks in this state, and the denominator of which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks everywhere, plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph, premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks in this state, whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the election of the company be determined on the basis of the proportion which premiums written for insurance accepted from companies commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to premiums written for reinsurance accepted from all sources, or alternatively in the proportion which the sum of the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state by each ceding company from which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of the total direct premiums written by each such ceding company for the taxable year.</p>

<p>5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity, the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection, including the sale or other disposition of such property and any other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property for purposes of the tax imposed by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92565">Section 2355</a> of this title has an initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment factors shall be computed as follows:</p>

<p>a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayers real and tangible personal property everywhere owned or rented and used during the tax period.</p>

<p>(1) Property, the income from which is separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection, shall not be included in determining this fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of the investment in transportation and other equipment having no fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks and trailers, including machinery and equipment carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons automobiles and other similar equipment, in the proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by such equipment bears to total miles traveled,</p>

<p>(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals,</p>

<p>(3) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax Commission may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayers property;</p>

<p>b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total compensation for services rendered in the state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total compensation for services rendered everywhere during the tax period. Compensation, as used in this subsection means those paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary business but does not include officers salaries, wages and other compensation.</p>

<p>(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of such expenditure in connection with employees operating equipment over a fixed route, such as railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus drivers, in this state only a part of the time, in the proportion that mileage traveled in Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such employees,</p>

<p>(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of such expenditures in connection with itinerant employees, such as traveling salespersons, in this state only a part of the time, in the proportion that time spent in Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;</p>

<p>c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Sales, as used in this subsection does not include sales or gross revenue which are separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection.</p>

<p>(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs in this state if the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser other than the United States government, within this state regardless of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale; or the property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory or other place of storage in this state and (a) the purchaser is the United States government or (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the state of the destination of the shipment.</p>

<p>(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall not be less than the allocation of revenues to this state as shown in its annual report to the Corporation Commission.</p>

<p>(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of revenue from interstate transportation in the proportion that interstate mileage traveled in Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage traveled.</p>

<p>(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall be either the total of traffic units of the enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator of which shall be the total of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A traffic unit is hereby defined as the transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case may be.</p>

<p>(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other communication enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include that portion of the interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to the accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission; provided that in respect to each corporation or business entity required by the Federal Communications Commission to keep its books and records in accordance with a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such Commission, the intrastate net income shall be determined separately in the manner provided by such uniform system of accounts and only the interstate income shall be subject to allocation pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Provided further, that the gross revenue factors shall be those as are determined pursuant to the accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

<p>In any case where the apportionment of the three factors prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable portion thereof.</p>

<p>6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999, and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which the investment was originally made.</p>

<p>7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:</p>

<p>a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or</p>

<p>b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of the income from all other sources other than reflected on Schedule F.</p>

<p>8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.

<p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, or of the Internal Revenue Code to the contrary, this subsection shall control calculation of depreciation of assets placed into service after December 31, 1981, and before January 1, 1983.</p>

<p>c. For the purpose of this paragraph, federal income taxes paid shall mean federal income taxes, surtaxes imposed on incomes or excess profits taxes, as though the taxpayer was on the accrual basis.

<p>(2) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of the original cost of such partnerships tangible property in this state to the original cost of such partnerships tangible property everywhere, as determined at the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the partnerships assets consists of intangible assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in the partnership shall be allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full tax period immediately preceding its tax period during which the ownership interest in the partnership was sold; the provisions of this division shall only apply if the capital or ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an ownership interest in a partnership do not constitute qualifying gain receiving capital treatment as defined in subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section,</p>

<p>(3) income from such property which is required to be allocated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this subsection shall be allocated as herein provided;</p>

<p>c. Net income or loss from a business activity which is not a part of business carried on within or without the state of a unitary character shall be separately allocated to the state in which such activity is conducted;</p>

<p>d. In the case of a manufacturing or processing enterprise the business of which in this state consists solely of marketing its products by:</p>

<p>(1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped directly to a point from without the state to a purchaser within the state, commonly known as interstate sales,</p>

<p>(2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses within the state pursuant to in transit tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser within the state,</p>

<p>(3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses within the state where the shipment to such warehouses is not covered by in transit tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser within or without the state,</p>

<p>the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived from the manufacture and/or processing and sales everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales defined in this section made to the purchaser within the state to the total sales everywhere. The term public warehouse as used in this subparagraph means a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of which is warehousing merchandise for the public;</p>

<p>e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:</p>

<p>(1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance company for a taxable year shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying such income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state, and the denominator of which is the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks everywhere. For purposes of this subsection, the term direct premiums written means the total amount of direct premiums written, assessments and annuity considerations as reported for the taxable year on the annual statement filed by the company with the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or such other form as may be prescribed in lieu thereof,</p>

<p>(2) if the principal source of premiums written by an insurance company consists of premiums for reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of such company shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying such income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks in this state, and the denominator of which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks everywhere, plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph, premiums written for reinsurance accepted in respect of property or risks in this state, whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the election of the company be determined on the basis of the proportion which premiums written for insurance accepted from companies commercially domiciled in this state bears to premiums written for reinsurance accepted from all sources, or alternatively in the proportion which the sum of the direct premiums written for insurance on property or risks in this state by each ceding company from which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of the total direct premiums written by each such ceding company for the taxable year.</p>

<p>5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity, the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection, including the sale or other disposition of such property and any other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment factors shall be computed as follows:</p>

<p>a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayers real and tangible personal property everywhere owned or rented and used during the tax period.</p>

<p>(1) Property, the income from which is separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection, shall not be included in determining this fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of the investment in transportation and other equipment having no fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks and trailers, including machinery and equipment carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons automobiles and other similar equipment, in the proportion that miles traveled in this state by such equipment bears to total miles traveled,</p>

<p>(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals,</p>

<p>(3) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax Commission may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayers property;</p>

<p>b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total compensation for services rendered in the state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total compensation for services rendered everywhere during the tax period. Compensation, as used in this subsection, means those paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary business but does not include officers salaries, wages and other compensation.</p>

<p>(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of such expenditure in connection with employees operating equipment over a fixed route, such as railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus drivers, in this state only a part of the time, in the proportion that mileage traveled in this state bears to total mileage traveled by such employees,</p>

<p>(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of such expenditures in connection with itinerant employees, such as traveling salespersons, in this state only a part of the time, in the proportion that time spent in this state bears to total time spent in furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;</p>

<p>c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Sales, as used in this subsection, does not include sales or gross revenue which are separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection.</p>

<p>(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs in this state if the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser other than the United States government, within this state regardless of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale; or the property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory or other place of storage in this state and (a) the purchaser is the United States government or (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the state of the destination of the shipment.</p>

<p>(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall not be less than the allocation of revenues to this state as shown in its annual report to the Corporation Commission.</p>

<p>(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include a portion of revenue from interstate transportation in the proportion that interstate mileage traveled in this state bears to total interstate mileage traveled.</p>

<p>(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall be either the total of traffic units of the enterprise within this state or the revenue allocated to this state based upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator of which shall be the total of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A traffic unit is hereby defined as the transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case may be.</p>

<p>(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other communication enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall include that portion of the interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to the accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission; provided that in respect to each corporation or business entity required by the Federal Communications Commission to keep its books and records in accordance with a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such Commission, the intrastate net income shall be determined separately in the manner provided by such uniform system of accounts and only the interstate income shall be subject to allocation pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Provided further, that the gross revenue factors shall be those as are determined pursuant to the accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

<p>In any case where the apportionment of the three factors prescribed in this paragraph attributes to this state a portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been attributed to this state, or require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to this state, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income attributable to this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise must attribute to this state only a reasonable portion thereof.</p>

<p>6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999, and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which the investment was originally made.</p>

<p>For purposes of this paragraph:</p>

<p>a. Agricultural commodity processing facility means buildings, structures, fixtures and improvements used or operated primarily for the processing or production of marketable products from agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not include a facility that provides only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation of agricultural commodities, and</p>

<p>b. Facility means each part of the facility which is used in a process primarily for:</p>

<p>(1) the processing of agricultural commodities, including receiving or storing agricultural commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy operation,</p>

<p>(2) transporting the agricultural commodities or product before, during or after the processing, or</p>

<p>(3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for sale or shipment.</p>

<p>7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:</p>

<p>a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or</p>

<p>b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of the income from all other sources other than reflected on Schedule F.</p>

<p>8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income. The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this paragraph, qualified wages means those wages used to calculate the federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.</p>

<p>9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an employer that is eligible for and utilizes the Safety Pays OSHA Consultation Service provided by the Oklahoma Department of Labor shall receive an exemption from taxable income in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the tax year that the service is utilized.</p>

<p>10. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010, there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to the amount of deferred income not included in such taxable income pursuant to Section 108(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended by Section 1231 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5). There shall be subtracted from Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to the amount of deferred income included in such taxable income pursuant to Section 108(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code by Section 1231 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5).</p>

<p>11. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, there shall be subtracted from Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted gross income any item of income or gain, and there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted gross income any item of loss or deduction that in the absence of an election pursuant to the provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019 would be allocated to a member or to an indirect member of an electing pass-through entity pursuant to Section 2351 et seq. of this title, if (i) the electing pass-through entity has accounted for such item in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and (ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall promulgate rules for the reporting of such exclusion to direct and indirect members of the electing pass-through entity. As used in this paragraph, electing pass-through entity, indirect member, and member shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by Section 2355.1P-2 of this title.

<p>12. For tax year 2025 and subsequent tax years, an employer providing paid leave to an employee for the purpose of volunteering as a poll worker with a county election board in this state shall receive an exemption from taxable income in the amount of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each day of leave provided in the tax year. The employer shall provide documentation from the applicable county election board showing the employee volunteered, upon request of the Oklahoma Tax Commission.</p>

The Oklahoma tax basis for all such assets placed into service after December 31, 1981, calculated in this section shall be retained and utilized for all Oklahoma income tax purposes through the final disposition of such assets.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, or of the Internal Revenue Code to the contrary, this subsection shall control calculation of depreciation of assets placed into service after December 31, 1981, and before January 1, 1983.</p>

<p>For assets placed in service and held by a corporation in which the Accelerated Cost Recovery System was previously disallowed, an adjustment to taxable income is required in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1982, to reconcile the basis of such assets to the basis allowed in the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of this adjustment is to equalize the basis and allowance for depreciation accounts between that reported to the Internal Revenue Service and that reported to this state.</p>

<p>2. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and ending on or before December 31, 2009, there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income any amount in excess of One Hundred Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($175,000.00) which has been deducted as a small business expense under Internal Revenue Code, Section 179 as provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>

<p>D. 1. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, the taxable income of any corporation, estate or trust, shall be further adjusted for qualifying gains receiving capital treatment. Such corporations, estates or trusts shall be allowed a deduction from Oklahoma taxable income for the amount of qualifying gains receiving capital treatment earned by the corporation, estate or trust during the taxable year and included in the federal taxable income of such corporation, estate or trust.</p>

<p>2. As used in this subsection:</p>
