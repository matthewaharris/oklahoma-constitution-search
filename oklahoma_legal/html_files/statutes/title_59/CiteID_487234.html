<p>5.  The Commission or the Executive Committee or other committees of the Commission may convene in a closed, nonpublic meeting if the Commission or Executive Committee or other committees of the Commission shall discuss:</p>

<p>a.  noncompliance of a member state with its obligations under the Compact,</p>

<p>b.  the employment, compensation, discipline or other matters, practices or procedures related to specific employees or other matters related to the Commissions internal personnel practices and procedures,</p>

<p>c.  current, threatened or reasonably anticipated litigation,</p>

<p>e.  accusing any person of a crime or formally censuring any person,</p>

<p>f.  disclosure of trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential,</p>

<p>g.  disclosure of information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</p>

<p>h.  disclosure of investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes,</p>

<p>i.  disclosure of information related to any investigative reports prepared by or on behalf of or for use of the Commission or other committee charged with responsibility of investigation or determination of compliance issues pursuant to the Compact, or</p>

<p>j.  matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal or member state statute.</p>

<p>6.  If a meeting, or portion of a meeting, is closed pursuant to this provision, the Commissions legal counsel or designee shall certify that the meeting may be closed and shall reference each relevant exempting provision.</p>

<p>7.  The Commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of the views expressed.  All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in minutes.  All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the Commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>8.  Financing of the Commission:</p>

<p>a.  the Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities,</p>

<p>b.  the Commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue sources, donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, and</p>

<p>c.  the Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state or impose fees on other parties to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover its annual budget as approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources.  The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.</p>

<p>9.  The Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.</p>

<p>10.  The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.  However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Commission.</p>

<p>F.  Qualified Immunity, Defense, and Indemnification:</p>

<p>2.  The Commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining his or her own counsel; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from that persons intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.</p>

<p>3.  The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the Commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.</p>
