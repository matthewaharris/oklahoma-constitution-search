A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">SECTION 12: OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">A. Oversight.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compacts purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the Rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the Rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Member State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">a. Provide written notice to the defaulting State and other Member States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">b. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting States legislature, and each of the Member States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">F. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">G. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">H. Dispute Resolution.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between member and non-Member States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I. Enforcement.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or State law.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">SECTION 13: DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COUNSELING COMPACT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth Member State. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of Rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise Rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">B. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commissions initial adoption of the Rules shall be subject to the Rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">C. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">1. A Member States withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing States Professional Counseling Licensing Board to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any Professional Counseling licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">E. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">SECTION 14: CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any Member State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">SECTION 15: BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">A. A Licensee providing Professional Counseling services in a Remote State under the Privilege to Practice shall adhere to the laws and regulations, including scope of practice, of the Remote State.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">B. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">C. Any laws in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">D. Any lawful actions of the Commission, including all Rules and bylaws properly promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the Member States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">E. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">F. In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Member State, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that Member State.</font></p>
