<p>A. The Oklahoma Funeral Board shall determine the qualifications necessary to enable any person to practice as a funeral director or embalmer, and prescribe the requirements for a funeral establishment or commercial embalming establishment. The Board shall examine all applicants for licenses to practice as a funeral director or embalmer. The Board shall issue the proper licenses to applicants who successfully pass such examination and qualify pursuant to any additional requirements the Board may prescribe.</p>

<p>B. 1. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, the minimum requirements for a license to practice funeral directing or embalming, or both, are as follows:</p>

<p>An applicant for a license to practice funeral directing or embalming shall be at least eighteen (18) years of age, a legal resident of this state, and a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. In addition, an applicant shall be a graduate of a program of mortuary science accredited by the American Board of Funeral Service Education, and have served one (1) year as a registered apprentice. The applicant may serve as a registered apprentice prior to enrollment in an approved school of mortuary science, or subsequent to graduation from the school, and pass any of the following relevant exams necessary for licensure: the International Conference of Funeral Service Examining Board National Board Science Examination, the International Conference of Funeral Service Examining Board National Board Arts Examination, the Oklahoma Funeral Directors Examination, or the Oklahoma Embalmers Examination with a seventy-five (75) or higher score on each exam.</p>

<p>2. Curriculum of study for an embalmer or funeral director is a program of mortuary science which shall be that prescribed by the American Board of Funeral Service Education.</p>

<p>C. 1. If a person chooses not to meet the qualifications in subsection B of this section for a funeral director, the person may alternatively qualify for a license to practice funeral directing, but not embalming, upon meeting the eligibility requirements of this subsection as follows:</p>

<p>An applicant for a license to practice funeral directing shall be at least eighteen (18) years of age, a legal resident of this state, and a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.

The applicant may serve as a registered apprentice prior to enrollment in an approved school of mortuary science, concurrently while in mortuary school, or subsequent to completion of the funeral director course of study.</p>

<p>2. Curriculum of study for a funeral director license shall be in a program of mortuary science which shall be that prescribed by the Oklahoma Funeral Board. An applicant must pay all fees as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=435931">Section 396.4</a> of this title and pass an exam provided by the International Conference of Funeral Service Examining Board or the Oklahoma Funeral Directors Exam with a score of seventy-five (75) or higher as well as pass a law exam provided by the Oklahoma Funeral Board, with a score of seventy-five (75) or higher. A license to practice as a funeral director issued pursuant to this subsection shall be restricted to funeral director, and the licensee shall not be eligible to practice as the funeral director in charge as defined in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=435927">Section 396.2</a> of this title.</p>

<p>3. If a person chooses not to meet the qualifications in subsection B of this section for an embalmer, the person may alternatively qualify for a license to practice embalming, upon meeting the eligibility requirements of this subsection as follows:</p>

<p>An applicant for a license of this state, a citizen or permanent resident of the United States, and of good moral character. An applicant is required to complete an embalmer course of study approved by the Oklahoma Funeral Board and that is administered by a program of funeral service/mortuary science accredited by the American Board of Funeral Service Education (ABFSE).

<p>4. Curriculum of study for an embalmer license shall be in a program of funeral service/mortuary science which shall be that prescribed by the Oklahoma Funeral Board. An applicant must pay all fees as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=435931">Section 396.4</a> of this title and pass the embalmer examination provided by the International Conference of Funeral Service Examining Board or the Oklahoma Embalmers Exam with a score of seventy-five (75) or higher as well as pass a law exam provided by the Oklahoma Funeral Board with a score of seventy-five (75) or higher.

<p>D. The Board shall issue the appropriate license to any qualified applicant whose application has been approved by the Board, and who has paid the fees required by <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=435931">Section 396.4</a> of this title, has passed the required examinations with a seventy-five (75) or higher score and has demonstrated to the Board proficiency as an embalmer or funeral director.</p>

<p>E. The Board shall maintain for public inspection a list of all accredited schools of embalming and mortuary science.</p>

<p>F. Each funeral director in charge as defined in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=435927">Section 396.2</a> of this title shall have a current dual funeral director and embalmer license. A funeral director in charge of a funeral service establishment or crematory that does not have a current dual funeral director and embalmer license on the effective date of this act shall be considered to be grandfathered and may serve as funeral director in charge of any funeral service establishment or crematory in accordance with rules prescribed by the Board, but shall not serve as funeral director in charge of a commercial embalming establishment which shall require a current dual funeral director and embalmer license.</p>

<p>G. Upon April 23, 2021, and for one (1) year thereafter, the Board may issue a temporary funeral director or embalmer license in the event a statewide state of emergency is declared by the Governor and during such time as the state of emergency is in effect.</p>
