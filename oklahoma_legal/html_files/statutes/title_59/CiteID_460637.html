<P>B. An applicant or qualifying party whose registration is denied, or the

otherwise fails to meet the requirements of application, may obtain a hearing 
before the Committee of Roofing Examiners in order to provide information in 
support of the application requirements and any other information showing the 
applicant's ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the 
Roofing Contractor Registration Act, and to protect the public health, safety 
and welfare.</P>
<P>C. To obtain a roofing contractor registration under the Roofing Contractor

<P>4. A copy of the roofing contractor's certificate of liability insurance 
shall be filed with the application and shall be not less than Five Hundred 
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) for residential roofing contractor work and shall

Act shall be suspended on the date of the policy cancellation. The registrar

<P>In addition, the roofing contractor shall submit proof that the contractor

<P>2. The applicant fails to provide a certificate of good standing or a trade 
name report from the Office of the Secretary of State;</P>
<P>3. The applicant, qualifying party, or any member of the legal entity fails 
or refuses to provide any information requested by the registrar;</P>
<P>4. The applicant fails or refuses to pay the required fees;</P>

Registration Act, the Construction Industries Board Act, or the Administrative 
Procedures Act, or the applicant may reapply after a ninety-day waiting period, 
if otherwise eligible under the provisions of the Roofing Contractor

<P>G. The registrar shall classify as not in good standing the registration of 
any roofing contractor who fails to:</P>

1151.14 of this title or a violation of the Roofing Contractor Registration 
Act;</P>
<P>8. Maintain a registration as required by law in another state while 
registered in this state as a nonresident roofing contractor; or</P>
<P>9. File and pay all taxes of the qualifying party and legal entity when due

<P>H. The registrar shall send a written notice to the qualifying party when his 
or her registration is not in good standing.</P>
<P>I. Any roofing contractor who has been notified by the registrar that his or 
her registration is not in good standing shall cease soliciting or entering new 
roofing services and projects as of the date of such notification; however, the 
roofing contractor shall be allowed to complete roofing projects where actual 
physical work has begun prior to the date of issuance of the notice that his or 
her registration is not in good standing. The roofing contractor must disclose 
the change in standing to any homeowner or other person who has an interest in 
any job covered under the Roofing Contractor Registration Act. Upon notice of a 
change in standing, the homeowner shall have the option to cancel the contract. 
The roofing contractor will be owed the actual cost incurred for materials and 
the market value of labor already incurred on the job. The roofing contractor 
must obtain an updated authorization from the homeowner and other parties of 
interest if there is an agreement to continue the job as originally negotiated. 
If the roofing contractor fails to correct the deficiency specified in the 
notice by evidence satisfactory to the registrar within thirty (30) days of the 
date of the notice, or if the roofing contractor solicits or enters into new 
roofing services contracts or projects while the roofing contractor's 
registration is not in good standing, or while such registration is suspended or 
revoked, the roofing contractor shall be in violation of the provisions of the 
Roofing Contractor Registration Act.</P>
<P>J. Any registration that remains not in good standing for a sixty-day period 
shall be suspended on the sixtieth day from the date of issuance of the notice 
to the roofing contractor that his or her registration is not in good standing.

suspended for such cause, shall be revoked on the ninetieth day from the date of 
issuance of the notice to the roofing contractor that his or her registration is 
not in good standing. The registrar shall notify the roofing contractor upon 
suspension or revocation of his or her registration for failure to comply in 
bringing such registration into good standing as required by law. The roofing 
contractor may reinstate his or her registration to good standing by paying the 
required fees provided in Section 1151.12 of this title and complying with all 
other requirements for issuance of a registration in good standing.</P>
<P>K. Any registrant, qualifying party, or roofing company owner aggrieved by 
the decision of the registrar to suspend or revoke a registration pursuant to 
this section may appeal such decision as provided in this act or the
