<P>D. The Board may require an applicant for licensure or certification or a licensee or certificate holder to be examined on the applicants or holders medical knowledge and skills should the Board find, after due process, that there is probable cause to believe the licensee or certificate holder or applicant may be deficient in such knowledge and skills.</P>

<P>19. Failure to pay appropriately assessed fees or failure to make any personal appearance required by the Board or any of its officers;</P>
<P>20. The practice of veterinary medicine in the absence of a bona fide veterinarian-client-patient relationship.

<P>21. Providing vaccinations or elective surgical procedures on skunks, namely Mephitis mephitis (striped), Conepatus mesoleusus (hog-nosed), and Spilogale putorius (spotted), unless the animal is under the custody and care of a recognized zoological institution, research facility, or person possessing an appropriate and current wildlife permit issued by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation or Oklahoma Department of Agriculture; or</P>
<P>22. Violation of any provisions of the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act or the rules and policies of the Board or of an action, stipulation or agreement of the Board.</P>

The Board shall take appropriate enforcement action when required, assuring fairness and due process to the defendant.</P>
<P>2. The Board or its designee may hold informal conferences to negotiate a settlement of a dispute; provided that the conference is agreed to in writing by all parties and said conference does not preclude a hearing on the same matters. The Board shall not consider the agreement binding should a hearing be held subsequent to the agreement.</P>
<P>G. The Board may summarily suspend a license or certificate prior to a formal hearing when it has found upon clear and convincing evidence that such action is required to protect the public or animal health or welfare or when a person under the jurisdiction of the Board is convicted of a felony, whether or not related to the practice of veterinary medicine; provided such action is taken simultaneously with proceedings for setting a formal hearing to be held within thirty (30) days after the summary suspension.</P>
<P>H. 1. The Board may issue an order to any licensee or certificate holder, obtain an injunction or take other administrative, civil or criminal court action against any person or any corporation or association, its officers, or directors, to restrain said persons from violating the provisions of the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act.</P>
<P>2. Violations of an injunction shall be punishable as contempt of court. No proof of actual damage to any animal shall be required for issuance of an order or an injunction, nor shall an injunction relieve those enjoined from administrative, civil or criminal prosecution for violation of the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act.</P>
<P>I. 1. The State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the license or certificate of any person holding license or certificate to practice veterinary medicine in this state or place such person on probation for unprofessional conduct, but no such suspension or revocation or refusal to renew, or probation shall be made, unless otherwise provided for herein, until such be cited to appear for hearing. No such citation shall be issued except upon a sworn complaint filed with the president or secretary-treasurer of said Board charging the licensee or certificate holder with having been guilty of unprofessional conduct and setting forth the particular act or acts alleged to constitute such unprofessional conduct.</P>
<P>2. In the event it comes to the attention of the Board that a violation of the rules of professional conduct may have occurred, even though a formal complaint or charge may not have been filed, the Board may conduct an investigation of such possible violation, and may, upon its own motion, institute a formal complaint. In the course of such investigation, persons appearing before the Board may be required to testify under oath.</P>
<P>J. 1. Upon the filing of a complaint, either by an individual or the Board, the citation shall be issued by the president or secretary-treasurer of the Board over such officers signature and seal of the Board, setting forth the particulars of the complaint, and giving due notice of the time and place of the hearing by the Board. The citation shall be made returnable at the next meeting of the Board at which hearing is set and shall be no less than thirty (30) days after issuance of the citation;</P>
<P>2. The accused shall file a written answer under oath with notice of intent to appear or be represented within twenty (20) days after the service of the citation. Failure to respond to the citation within the prescribed time shall constitute default;</P>
<P>3. The license or certificate of the accused shall be suspended, revoked or not renewed if the charges are found, by clear and convincing evidence, sufficient by the Board; provided, the president or secretary-treasurer of the Board may extend the time of answer upon satisfactory showing that the defendant is for reasonable cause, unable to answer within the prescribed twenty (20) days, but in no case shall the time be extended beyond the date of the next scheduled meeting for hearing the complaint, unless continuance thereof be granted by the Board; and</P>
<P>4. All citations and subpoenas under the contemplation of the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act shall be served in general accordance with the statutes of this state applying to the service of such documents. All provisions of the statutes of this state relating to citations and subpoenas are hereby made applicable to the citations and subpoenas herein provided. All the provisions of the statutes of this state governing the taking of testimony by depositions are made applicable to the taking of depositions pursuant to the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act.</P>
<P>K. The Executive Director, secretary-treasurer, designee, or prosecuting attorney for the Board, during the course of any lawful investigation, may order or subpoena the attendance of witnesses, the inspection of records, and premises and the production of relevant records, books, memoranda, documents, radiographs, or other papers or things for the investigation of matters that may come before the Board.</P>
<P>L. 1. The attendance of witnesses may be compelled in such hearings by subpoenas issued by the president or secretary-treasurer of the Board over the seal thereof, and the president or secretary-treasurer shall in no case refuse to issue subpoenas upon praecipe filed therefor accompanied by the fee set by the Board by rule for the issuance of such subpoenas.</P>
<P>2. If any person refuses to obey a subpoena properly served upon such person or in the manner, the fact of such refusal shall be certified by the secretary-treasurer of the Board over the seal thereof to the district attorney of the county in which such service was had, and the court shall proceed to hear said matter in accordance with the statutes of this state then in force governing contempt as for disobedience of its own process.</P>
<P>M. 1. The State of Oklahoma is a proper and necessary party in the prosecution of all such actions and hearings before the Board in all matters pertaining to unprofessional conduct and disciplinary action. The Attorney General of the state, in person or by deputy, is authorized to appear in behalf thereof. The defendant in any such actions shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
<P>2. The Board is empowered to enter into agreement with or employ one or more attorneys to conduct the business of the Board in the absence of representation by the Attorney General or designee or in conjunction with representation by the Attorney General or designee.</P>
<P>3. The Board shall sit as a trial body and the rulings of the Board shall be by majority vote. Appeal to the rulings thereof shall be by petition to the district court of the district in which the hearing was held. The secretary-treasurer of the Board shall cause a record of all proceedings to be made and a transcript of the proceedings or any part thereof may be obtained by payment of actual cost of taking and preparation of transcript of such proceedings or part thereof.</P>
<P>N. All final disciplinary actions, license denials, related findings of fact and conclusions of law are matters of public record. Voluntary surrender of and voluntary limitations on the veterinarian's practice or license shall be public record.</P>
<P>O. Certificate holders or faculty of veterinary medical schools shall report to the Board in writing any information that gives reason to believe a veterinarian is incompetent, guilty of unprofessional conduct or is unable to engage safely in the practice of veterinary medicine. Cause for reporting shall be for, but not limited to, the following instances:</P>
<P>1. Voluntary resignation from a professional partnership, corporation or practice for reason of inability to practice;</P>
<P>2. Malpractice claims, judgments, settlements or awards;</P>
<P>3. Civil or criminal convictions; or</P>
<P>4. Other actions that indicate inability to practice with reasonable skill and safety.</P>
<P>P. The Board shall consider violation of any of the Rules of Professional Conduct a violation of the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act section on unprofessional conduct and shall proceed with disciplinary action as set out in the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act.</P>
<P>Q. 1. In addition to other penalties prescribed by the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act, any person who the Board has determined by clear and convincing evidence to have violated any provisions of the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act, or any rule or order issued pursuant thereto shall be liable for an administrative penalty of not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each day that the violation continues.</P>
<P>2. The amount of the penalty shall be assessed by the Board pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection, after notice and hearing. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Board shall, by clear and convincing evidence, include, but not be limited to, consideration of the nature, circumstances, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the person found to have committed the violation, the degree of culpability, the effect on ability of the person to continue to do business, and any show of good faith in attempting to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act.</P>
<P>3. All penalties collected pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be deposited in the Veterinary Medical Examiners Fund.</P>
