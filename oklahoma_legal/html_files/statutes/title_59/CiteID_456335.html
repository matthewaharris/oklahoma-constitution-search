<p>A. Applicants for a license shall apply on a form as prescribed by the Administrator of Consumer Credit.</p>

<p>B. In order to fulfill the purposes of the Oklahoma Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, the Administrator is authorized to establish relationships or contracts with the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry or other entities designated by the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry to collect and maintain records and process transaction fees or other fees related to licensees or other entities or individuals subject to the Oklahoma Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act.</p>

<p>C. In connection with an application for licensing as a mortgage loan originator, the applicant shall, at a minimum, furnish to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry information concerning the applicants identity including:</p>

<p>1. Fingerprints for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and any governmental agency or entity authorized to receive such information for a state, national and international criminal history background check; and</p>

<p>2. Personal history and experience in a form prescribed by the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry and the Administrator to obtain:</p>

<p>a. an independent credit report obtained from a consumer reporting agency defined in 15 U.S.C., Section 1681a(p), and</p>

<p>b. information related to any administrative, civil or criminal findings by any governmental jurisdiction.</p>

<p>D. In connection with an application for licensing as a mortgage broker or mortgage lender, the applicant shall, at a minimum, furnish to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry information concerning each owner, officer, director or partner, as applicable including:</p>

<p>E. For purposes of this section and in order to reduce points of contact which the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have to maintain for purposes of paragraph 1 and subparagraph b of paragraph 2 of subsection D of this section, the Administrator may use the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry as a channeling agent for requesting information from and distributing information to the United States Department of Justice or any governmental agency.</p>

<p>F.
