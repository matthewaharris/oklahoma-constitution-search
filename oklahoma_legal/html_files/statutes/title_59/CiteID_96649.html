CLEET may deny, suspend or withdraw a conditional license by mailing, by United States Postal Service mail, a letter of withdrawal to the applicant's address on file with CLEET and to the employing agency;</P>

<P>b. If an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation records check and a local records check reveal that there are no felony convictions, criminal convictions involving moral turpitude, or any other potential disqualifiers as specified in the Oklahoma Security Guard and Private Investigator Act or prescribed by the Council, then the Council may conditionally issue a security guard license or private investigator license pending completion of the criminal history and background check.</P>
<P>c. Under oath, the applicant shall certify that he or she has no disqualifying convictions, entry of a plea of guilty, nolo contendere, an "Alford" plea, or any plea other than a not guilty plea for a disqualifying charge as specified in the Oklahoma Security Guard and Private Investigator Act or by the Council.</P>

For purposes of this subsection, "currently undergoing treatment for a mental illness, condition, or disorder" means the person has been diagnosed by a licensed physician or psychologist as being afflicted with a substantial disorder of thought, mood, perception, psychological orientation, or memory that significantly impairs judgment, behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life and such condition continues to exist; </P>
