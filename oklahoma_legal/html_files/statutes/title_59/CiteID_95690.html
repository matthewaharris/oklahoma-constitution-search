<p>2. "Professional Structural Engineer", "P.E., S.E." or "S.E." means an individual who has been duly licensed as a professional engineer by the Board, and who has been further authorized by the Board to use the title Professional Structural Engineer, P.E. S.E., or S.E., and perform structural engineering analysis and design services for significant structures based upon education, experience and examinations as described in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=481120">Section 475.12c</a> of this title. For purposes of this definition, the term "significant structures" shall not include any structure that is a residential structure;</p>

<p>3. "Engineer Intern" or "E.I." means a person who complies with the requirement for education and has passed an examination in the fundamental engineering subjects, as provided in this act and the regulations issued by the Board pursuant thereto;</p>

<p>4. "Practice of engineering" means any service or creative work requiring engineering education, training and experience in the application of engineering principles and the interpretation of engineering data to engineering activities, including the engineering design of buildings, structures, products, machines, processes, and systems, that potentially impact the life, health, property and welfare of the public. The services may include, but are not limited to, providing planning, studies, designs, design coordination, drawings, specifications, and other technical submissions; engineering reports or material developed in connection with expert witness testimony or anticipated testimony; commissioning of engineered systems; and performing surveying that is incidental to the practice of engineering and reviewing construction or other design products for the purposes of monitoring compliance with drawings and specifications related to engineered works. Surveying incidental to the practice of engineering excludes the surveying of real property for the establishment or determination of land boundaries, rights-of-way, easements, and the dependent or independent surveys or resurveys of the United States Public Land Survey System and is limited to conducting field measurements to supplement the documentation of existing conditions. Unless a Professional Surveyor has provided the professional engineer with geocentric/geodetic control coordinates which meet the accuracy standards set forth in OAC 245:15-13-2, the professional engineer shall only use a coordinate system based on assumed values for the project, and so state on the documents. These services or work, either public or private, may be performed in connection with any utilities, structures, buildings, machines, equipment, processes, work systems, projects, communication systems, transportation systems and industrial or consumer products or equipment of a mechanical, electrical, chemical, environmental, hydraulic, pneumatic, thermal, control system or communications nature, insofar as they involve safeguarding life, health or property, and including such other professional services as may be necessary to the design coordination of a multidiscipline work, planning, progress and completion of any engineering services.</p>

<p>(4) roof plans and details depicting the design of roof system materials, components, drainage, slopes, and directions and location of roof accessories and equipment not involving structural engineering calculations.</p>

<p>c. The following activities may be performed by an engineer:</p>

<p>(1) programming for construction projects, including:</p>

<p>(a) identification of economic, legal, and natural constraints, and</p>

<p>(b) determination of the scope of functional elements,</p>

<p>(2) recommending and overseeing appropriate construction project delivery systems,</p>
