The performance of an abortion on the basis of the mental or emotional health of the mother shall be a violation of this paragraph, notwithstanding a claim or diagnosis that the woman may engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death. The Board shall impose a penalty as provided in this section and in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=95919">Section 637.1</a> of this title on a licensee who violates this paragraph.

<p>B. The Board may enter an order denying licensure or imposing any of the penalties as prescribed by rule against any applicant for licensure or licensee who is found guilty of violating any provision of subsection A of this section. In determining what action is appropriate, the Board shall first consider what sanctions are necessary to protect the public or to compensate the patient. Only after those sanctions have been imposed may the Board consider and include in the order requirements designed to rehabilitate the physician. All costs associated with compliance with orders issued under this subsection shall be the obligation of the physician.</p>

<p>C. In any administrative action against a physician that does not involve revocation or suspension of a license, the Board shall have the burden, by the greater weight of the evidence, to establish the existence of grounds for disciplinary action. The Board shall establish grounds for revocation or suspension of a license by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

<p>D. The Board shall not reinstate the license or certificate of an osteopathic physician, or cause a license or certificate to be issued to a person it has deemed unqualified, until such time as it is satisfied that he or she has complied with all the terms and conditions set forth in the final order and that such person is capable of safely engaging in the practice of osteopathic medicine. However, the Board shall not issue a license to, or reinstate the license of, any osteopathic physician found by the Board to have committed repeated medical malpractice, regardless of the extent to which the licensee or prospective licensee has complied with all terms and conditions set forth in the final order or is capable of safely engaging in the practice of osteopathic medicine.</p>

<p>E. The State Board of Osteopathic Examiners shall neither refuse to renew, nor suspend, nor revoke any license, however, for any of these causes, unless the person accused has been given at least twenty (20) days notice in writing of the charge against him or her and a public hearing by the Board; provided, three-fourths (3/4) of a quorum present at a meeting may vote to suspend a license in an emergency situation if the licensee affected is provided a public hearing within thirty (30) days of the emergency suspension.</p>

<p>F. The State Board of Osteopathic Examiners shall have the power to order or subpoena the attendance of witnesses, the inspection of records and premises and the production of relevant books and papers for the investigation of matters that may come before it. The presiding officer of the Board or his or her designee shall have the authority to compel the giving of testimony as is conferred on courts of justice.</p>
