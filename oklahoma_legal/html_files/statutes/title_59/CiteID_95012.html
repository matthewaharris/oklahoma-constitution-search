Such a statement or implication of special knowledge or competence may arise from use by the issuer of the report of names or titles indicating that the person or firm is an accountant or auditor, or from the language of the report itself. The term report includes any form of language which disclaims an opinion when such form of language is conventionally understood to imply any positive assurance as to the reliability of the attested information or compiled financial statements referred to and/or special competence on the part of the person or firm issuing such language; and it includes any other form of language that is conventionally understood to imply such assurance and/or such special knowledge or competence. This definition is not intended to include a report prepared by a person not holding a certificate or license or not granted practice privileges under Section 15.12A of this title.

<p>44. Representation means any oral or written communication including but not limited to the use of title or legends on letterheads, business cards, office doors, advertisements, and listings conveying the fact that an individual or entity holds a certificate, license or permit;</p>

<p>45. Review, when used with reference to financial statements, means a registrant or an individual granted practice privileges under Section 15.12A of this title, which also meets the requirements of paragraph 3 of subsection A of Section 15.15 of this title, or a firm exempt from the permit and registration requirements under Section 15.15C of this title performing inquiry and analytical procedures that provide the registrant with a reasonable basis for expressing limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the statements in order for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or, if applicable, with another comprehensive basis of accounting; and</p>

<p>46. Substantial equivalency is a determination by the Oklahoma Accountancy Board or its designee that:</p>

<p>a. the education, examination and experience requirements contained in the statutes and administrative rules of another jurisdiction are comparable to, or exceed, the education, examination and experience requirements contained in the AICPA/NASBA Uniform Accountancy Act, or</p>

<p>b. that an individual certified public accountants or public accountants education, examination and experience qualifications are comparable to or exceed the education, examination and experience requirements contained in the Oklahoma Accountancy Act and rules of the Board.</p>

<p>In ascertaining substantial equivalency as used in the Oklahoma Accountancy Act, the Board or its designee shall take into account the qualifications without regard to the sequence in which experience, education, or examination requirements were attained.</p>
