<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>The Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact is hereby enacted into law and 
entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining therein, in the form 
substantially as follows:</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 1. FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY, AND PURPOSE</P>
<P>A. The participating states find that the following provisions apply:</P>
<P>1. Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the 
benefit of all residents and visitors;</P>
<P>2. The protection of the wildlife resources of a state is materially affected 
by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, 
and administrative rules relating to the management of such resources;</P>
<P>3. The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife 
contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of 
such natural resources;</P>
<P>4. Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; 
therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, 
protection, management and restoration laws, ordinances, regulations, and 
administrative rules of the participating states as a condition precedent to the 
continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess 
wildlife;</P>
<P>5. Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife 
resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property;</P>
<P>6. The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance 
of channels of communication among the various states;</P>
<P>7. In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a 
state other than that person's own state:</P>
<P>a. is required to post collateral or a bond to secure appearance for a trial 
at a later date,</P>
<P>b. is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted, or</P>
<P>c. is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance;</P>
<P>8. The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph 7 of this 
subsection is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the 
cited person who, if permitted to proceed after receiving the citation, could 
return to the home state of the person and disregard their duty under the terms 
of the citation;</P>
<P>9. In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the home 
state of the person is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the 
scene of the violation and immediately proceed after agreeing or being 
instructed to comply with the terms of the citation;</P>
<P>10. The practices described in paragraph 7 of this subsection cause 
unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable 
at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine and 
is thus compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is 
made; and</P>
<P>11. The enforcement practices described in paragraph 7 of this subsection 
consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.</P>
<P>B. It is the policy of the participating states to:</P>
<P>1. Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and 
administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their 
respective states;</P>
<P>2. Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person 
whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and may 
treat the suspension as if it had occurred in their state;</P>
<P>3. Allow a violator, except as provided in subsection B of Article 3 of this 
compact, to accept a wildlife citation and proceed without delay, whether or not 
a resident of the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the home 
state of the violator is party to this compact;</P>
<P>4. Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in the compact 
manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the 
issuing state;</P>
<P>5. Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against 
its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though 
they occurred in the home state;</P>
<P>6. Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states 
for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one 
participating state to a resident of another participating state;</P>
<P>7. Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information; 
and</P>
<P>8. Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife 
violations.</P>
<P>C. The purpose of this compact is to:</P>
<P>1. Provide a means through which participating states may join in a 
reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection B of this 
article in a uniform and orderly manner; and</P>
<P>2. Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators 
operating within participating states in recognition of the violator's right to 
due process and the sovereign status of a participating state.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS</P>
<P>As used in this compact, unless the context requires otherwise, the following 
definitions apply:</P>
<P>1. "Citation" means any summons, complaint, summons and complaint, ticket,

license privileges, including the privilege to apply for, purchase, or exercise 
the benefits conferred by any license;</P>
<P>14. "Terms of the citation" means those conditions and options expressly 
stated in the citation;</P>
<P>15. "Wildlife" means all species of animals including mammals, birds, fish, 
reptiles, amphibians, mollusks, and crustaceans, which are defined as "wildlife" 
and are protected or otherwise regulated by statute, law, regulation, ordinance,

<P align=center>ARTICLE 3. PROCEDURES FOR ISSUING STATE</P>
<P>A. When issuing a citation for a wildlife violation, a wildlife officer shall 
issue a citation to any person whose primary residence is in a participating 
state in the same manner as though the person were a resident of the issuing 
state and may not require the person to post collateral to secure appearance, 
subject to the exceptions noted in subsection B of this article, if the officer 
receives the recognizance of the person that the person will comply with the 
terms of the citation.</P>
<P>B. Personal recognizance is acceptable if:</P>
<P>1. Not prohibited by state or local law or the compact manual; and </P>
<P>2. The violator provides adequate proof of identification to the wildlife 
officer.</P>
<P>C. Upon conviction or failure of a person to comply with the terms of a 
wildlife citation, the appropriate official shall report the conviction or 
failure to comply to the licensing authority of the participating state in which 
the wildlife citation was issued. The report must be made in accordance with 
procedures specified by the issuing state and must contain information as 
specified in the compact manual as minimum requirements for effective processing 
by the home state.</P>
<P>D. Upon receipt of the report of conviction or noncompliance pursuant to 
subsection C of this article, the licensing authority of the issuing state shall 
transmit to the licensing authority of the home state of the violator the 
information in form and content as prescribed in the compact manual.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 4. PROCEDURE FOR HOME STATE</P>
<P>A. Upon receipt of a report from the licensing authority of the issuing state 
reporting the failure of a violator to comply with the terms of a citation, the 
licensing authority of the home state shall notify the violator and may initiate 
a suspension action in accordance with the suspension procedures of the home 
state and may suspend the license privileges of the violator until satisfactory 
evidence of compliance with the terms of the wildlife citation has been 
furnished by the issuing state to the home state licensing authority. Due 
process safeguards will be accorded. </P>
<P>B. Upon receipt of a report of conviction from the licensing authority of the 
issuing state, the licensing authority of the home state may enter the 
conviction in its records and may treat the conviction as though it occurred in 
the home state for the purposes of the suspension of license privileges if the 
violation resulting in a suspension could have been the basis for suspension of 
license privileges in the home state.</P>
<P>C. The licensing authority of the home state shall maintain a record of 
actions taken and shall make reports to issuing states as provided in the 
compact manual.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 5. RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION OF SUSPENSION</P>
<P>A. All participating states may recognize the suspension of license 
privileges of any person by any participating state as though the violation 
resulting in the suspension had occurred in their state and could have been the 
basis for suspension of license privileges in their state.</P>
<P>B. Each participating state shall communicate suspension information to other 
participating states in form and content as contained in the compact manual.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 6. APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS</P>
<P>Except as expressly required by this compact, nothing herein may be construed 
to affect the right of any participating state to apply any of its laws relating 
to license privileges to any person or circumstance or to invalidate or prevent 
any agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a participating state and 
a nonparticipating state concerning wildlife law enforcement.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 7. COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR - PROCEDURES</P>
<P>A. For the purposes of administering this compact and to serve as a governing 
body for the resolution of all matters relating to the operation of this 
compact, a board of compact administrators is established. The board is composed 
of one representative from each of the participating states to be known as the 
compact administrator. The compact administrator must be appointed by the head 
of the licensing authority of each participating state and serves and is subject 
to removal in accordance with the laws of the state the compact administrator 
represents. A compact administrator may provide for the discharge of duties and 
the performance of functions as a board member by an alternate. An alternate is 
not entitled to serve unless written notification of the identity of the 
alternate has been given to the board.</P>
<P>B. Each member of the board of compact administrators is entitled to one 
vote. No action of the board is binding unless taken at a meeting at which a 
majority of the total number of the votes by the board are cast in favor 
thereof. Action by the board may be only at a meeting at which a majority of the 
participating states is represented.</P>
<P>C. The board shall elect annually from its membership a presiding officer and 
a vice presiding officer.</P>
<P>D. The board shall adopt bylaws not inconsistent with the provisions of this 
compact or the laws of a participating state for the conduct of its business and 
may amend and rescind its bylaws.</P>
<P>E. The board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this 
compact any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, 
materials, and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United 
States, or any governmental agency, and receive, utilize, and dispose of the 
same.</P>
<P>F. The board may contract with, or accept services or personnel from, any 
governmental or intergovernmental agency, individual, firm, or corporation, or 
any private nonprofit organization or institution.</P>
<P>G. The board shall formulate all necessary procedures and develop uniform 
forms and documents for administering the provisions of this compact. All 
procedures and forms adopted pursuant to board action must be contained in a 
compact manual.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 8. ENTRY INTO COMPACT AND WITHDRAWAL</P>
<P>A. This compact becomes effective at such time as it is adopted in a 
substantially similar form by two or more states.</P>
<P>B. 1. Entry into the compact must be made by resolution of ratification 
executed by the authorized officials of the applying state and submitted to the 
presiding officer of the board.</P>
<P>2. The resolution must substantially be in the form and content as provided 
in the compact manual and must include the following:</P>
<P>a. a citation of the authority from which the state is empowered to become a 
party to this compact,</P>
<P>b. an agreement of compliance with the terms and provisions of this compact, 
and</P>
<P>c. an agreement that compact entry is with all states participating in the 
compact and with all additional states legally becoming a party to the 
compact.</P>
<P>3. The effective date of entry must be specified by the applying state but 
may not be less than sixty (60) days after notice has been given by the: </P>
<P>a. presiding officer of the board of the compact administrators, or</P>
<P>b. secretariat of the board to each participating state that the resolution 
from the applying state has been received.</P>
<P>C. A participating state may withdraw from participation in this compact by 
official written notice to each participating state, but withdrawal does not 
become effective until ninety (90) days after the notice of withdrawal is given. 
The notice must be directed to the compact administrator of each member state. 
Withdrawal of any state does not affect the validity of this compact as to the 
remaining participating states.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 9. AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPACT</P>
<P>A. This compact may be amended from time to time. Amendments must be 
presented in resolution form to the presiding officer of the board of the 
compact administrators and must be initiated by one or more participating 
states.</P>
<P>B. Adoption of an amendment requires endorsement by all participating states 
and becomes effective thirty (30) days after the date of the last 
endorsement.</P>
<P>C. Failure of a participating state to respond to the compact presiding 
officer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of a proposed 
amendment constitutes endorsement thereof.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE 10. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</P>
<P>This compact must be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 
stated herein. The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, 
clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the 
constitution of any participating state or the United States, or the 
applicability thereof to any government, agency, individual, or circumstance is 
held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the compact is not affected 
thereby. If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of any 
participating state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the 
remaining states and in full force and effect as to the participating state 
affected as to all severable matters.</P>
