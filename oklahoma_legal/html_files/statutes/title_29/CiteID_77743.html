<p>A. Except as otherwise provided in the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Code, no person shall fish, pursue, harass, catch, kill, take in any manner, use, have in possession, sell, or transport all or any portion of fish without having first procured a license for such from the Director or from any of the authorized agents of the Department of Wildlife Conservation. The Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Commission may designate two (2) days per year in which residents and nonresidents may fish without first procuring a fishing license pursuant to the provisions of this section.</p>

<p>B. The following legal residents of Oklahoma and the following nonresidents shall be exempt from the annual fishing license requirements of subsection C of this section:</p>

<p>1. Legal residents under eighteen (18) years of age and nonresidents under eighteen (18) years of age;</p>

<p>2. Legal residents sixty-five (65) years of age or older and nonresidents sixty-five (65) years of age or older from states which do not require nonresident fishing licenses for persons sixty-five (65) years of age or older, provided a legal resident has obtained a senior citizen lifetime fishing or combination hunting and fishing license pursuant to the provisions of Section 4-114 of this title;</p>

<p>3. Legal resident veterans having a disability of sixty percent (60%) or more and registered with the veterans registry created by the Oklahoma Department of Veterans Affairs; provided, that if the veteran has previously received an exemption pursuant to this paragraph, no registration with the veterans registry shall be required. The Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Commission shall promulgate any rules necessary to implement the provisions of this paragraph;</p>

<p>4. Legal resident owners or tenants, their spouses, parents, grandparents, children and their spouses, grandchildren and their spouses who fish in private ponds on land owned or leased by them;</p>

<p>5. Any legal resident or nonresident who is a patient of an institution of the State of Oklahoma established for the care and treatment of mental illness or alcohol or drug dependency or any developmentally disabled person residing in any group home or other institution or developmentally disabled persons when accompanied by an attendant of the institution or legal guardian of the patient, or when fishing on institutional property;</p>

<p>6. Any legal resident or nonresident who is legally blind or who has any other physical impairment, as certified by a physician licensed in this state or any state which borders this state, which prevents the person from properly using fishing apparatus without the assistance of another person, and any one person actually accompanying and actually assisting such legally blind or otherwise physically impaired person while the latter is fishing. This certification shall be carried by the individual while fishing;</p>

<p>7. Any legal resident or nonresident who is a Job Corps trainee of this state, provided that the trainees shall have on their persons a duly authorized identification card issued by their respective Job Corps Center and shall present the card upon request, in lieu of a fishing license. The trainees shall return their cards to their respective Job Corps Center when the trainees leave their respective Job Corps training programs;</p>

<p>8. Any legal resident having a proven disability which renders the resident nonambulatory and confined to a wheelchair as certified by a physician licensed in this state or any state which borders this state;</p>

<p>9. Any legal resident who is fishing with a pole and line, trotline, or throwline in streams, natural lakes, natural ponds, and mine pits in the county in which the person is a resident, or in streams, natural lakes, natural ponds, and mine pits which form a part of the boundary line of the county in which the person is a resident, when using any bait other than commercial or artificial bait, blood, stink bait, cut fish, and shrimp; and</p>

<p>10. Any legal resident or nonresident participating in an aquatic education event or clinic sanctioned by the Department of Wildlife Conservation.</p>

<p>C. Except as otherwise provided for in the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Code, the fishing licenses issued pursuant to the provisions of this section and the fee for each shall be:</p>

<p>1. Annual fishing license for legal residents eighteen (18) years of age and older, valid for one (1) year from the date of issuance - Thirty Dollars ($30.00);</p>

<p>2. Annual fishing license for nonresidents, valid for one (1) year from the date of issuance - Eighty Dollars ($80.00), provided the Commission may enter into reciprocity agreements with states wherein nonresident license fees shall be in conformity with such reciprocal agreements;</p>

<p>3. Daily fishing license for residents  Ten Dollars ($10.00); and</p>

<p>4. Daily fishing license for nonresidents  Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00).</p>

<p>D.

<p>E. 1. Any person arrested while violating the provisions of this section who does not meet the requirements of subsection H of this section, may purchase a substitute temporary thirty-day license from the arresting game warden in lieu of posting bond. The fee for a substitute license purchased pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be:</p>

<p>a. for legal residents, One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), and</p>

<p>b. for nonresidents, One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00).</p>

<p>2. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the fees from licenses purchased pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be deposited in the Wildlife Conservation Fund to be used exclusively for developing, managing, preserving, and protecting wildlife and wildlife habitat.</p>

<p>F. Unless a substitute license is purchased as provided for by subsection E of this section, any resident of this state convicted of violating the provisions of this section shall be punished by the imposition of a fine of not less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) nor more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>G. Unless a substitute license is purchased as provided for by subsection E of this section, any nonresident convicted of violating this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) nor more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not more than thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>H. Any person producing proof in court that a current fishing license issued by the Department of Wildlife Conservation to that person was in force at the time of the alleged offense shall be entitled to dismissal of a charge of violating this section upon payment of court costs. If proof of a current fishing license issued by the Department to the person that was in force at the time of the alleged offense is presented to the court or district attorney within seventy-two (72) hours after the violation, the charge shall be dismissed without payment of court costs.</p>
