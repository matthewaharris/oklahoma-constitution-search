<P>A. No gatherer shall charge any fee or require any terms and conditions of 
service, or both, for gathering, which is unfair, unjust, unreasonable, or 
unduly discriminatory under the standard specified in and as provided by 
subsection D of this section. Upon complaint of an aggrieved party filed 
pursuant to this act, the Corporation Commission shall have the authority to 
remedy any such fee or terms and conditions of service, or both, for gathering, 
by:</P>
<P>1. Ordering an adjustment of the fee or terms and conditions of service, or 
both, as to the aggrieved party to the extent necessary to remove any unfair, 
unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory portion of such fee or terms and 
conditions of service, or both, under the standard specified in and as provided 
by subsection D of this section; and, if applicable,</P>
<P>2. Ordering the continuation of gathering service during the pendency of the 
complaint as provided in subsection F of this section; or</P>
<P>3. Ordering the application of fees and terms and conditions of service 
established by an order previously issued by the Commission under this act be 
applied to a similarly situated shipper as specified in subsection L of this 
section.</P>
<P>Nothing in this section shall operate to abrogate the terms of an existing 
contract while the contract is in force. Upon the expiration or cancellation of 
an existing contract, under the terms of the contract, the provisions of this 
section shall apply.</P>
<P>B. No gatherer shall refuse to provide open access natural gas gathering, 
including the redelivery of such natural gas to existing redelivery points, for 
a fee for any person seeking such gathering for natural gas which is connected 
to the gatherer's pipeline unless the gatherer can demonstrate to the Commission 
that any of the following apply:</P>
<P>1. The continuation of gathering service on the basis requested by the 
complainant would require an additional capital investment, material to the well 
or wells at issue, by the gatherer and complainant is unable or unwilling to 
timely pay gatherer for all reasonable direct costs attributable to such capital 
investment together with that reasonable portion of a gatherers overhead 
directly related to such capital investment;</P>
<P>2. The continued gathering of such natural gas could reasonably be expected 
to have a material adverse effect on safety or service to existing 
customers;</P>
<P>3. The natural gas does not satisfy minimum standards for quality, including 
energy content, consistently applied by the gatherer for such gathering 
system;</P>
<P>4. The gathering service requested is inconsistent with an existing contract 
which governs the gathering of the complainant's natural gas; or</P>
<P>5. For such other good cause as the Commission may determine in the 
particular case.</P>
<P>Upon complaint of an aggrieved party connected to the gatherers pipeline, 
the Commission shall determine whether such gatherer is required by reason of 
this subsection to continue to provide open access natural gas gathering to such 
party, and if so, and the parties are unable to agree upon a fee or terms and 
conditions of service or both, for gathering, to fix a fee or terms and 
conditions of service, or both, for such gathering.</P>
<P>C. No gatherer shall refuse to provide open access natural gas gathering, 
including the redelivery of such natural gas to existing redelivery points, for 
a fee for any person seeking such gathering for natural gas which is not 
connected to gatherer's pipeline unless the gatherer can demonstrate that any of 
the following apply:</P>
<P>1. The natural gas cannot be reasonably carried by such gatherer due to 
existing capacity limitations on the gatherer's pipeline;</P>
<P>2. An extension or expansion of facilities would be required and the 
complainant is unable or unwilling to timely pay the gatherer for all reasonable 
direct costs attributable to such extension or expansion together with that 
reasonable portion of a gatherers overhead directly related to such extension 
or expansion of facilities;</P>
<P>3. The gathering of such natural gas could reasonably be expected to have a 
material adverse effect on safety or service to existing customers or on the 
operation of or recovery in any processing facility;</P>
<P>4. The natural gas does not satisfy minimum standards for quality or energy 
or recoverable hydrocarbon content consistently applied by the gatherer for such 
gathering system; or</P>
<P>5. For such other good cause as the Commission may determine in the 
particular case.</P>
<P>Upon complaint of an aggrieved party not connected to the gatherer's 
pipeline, the Commission shall determine whether a gatherer is required by 
reason of this subsection to provide open access natural gas gathering to such 
party, and if so, and the parties are unable to agree upon a fee or terms and 
conditions of service, or both, for gathering, to fix a fee or terms and 
conditions of service, or both, for such gathering.</P>
<P>D. Any action by the Commission under this act shall be initiated by the 
filing of a complaint with the Commission by the aggrieved party and the serving 
of a copy of such complaint upon the gatherer from whom gathering service is 
being requested. The Commission shall conduct a hearing and take such evidence 
as is necessary to determine the complaint. Notice of the hearing on such 
complaint shall be given by registered mail to such gatherer at least twenty 
(20) days prior to such hearing but in no event shall the hearing be less than 
thirty (30) days from the filing of the complaint. If the parties are unable to 
agree on an interim fee or terms and conditions of service, or both, for 
gathering to apply during the pendency of the complaint before the Commission, 
then the Commission may set such interim fee or terms and conditions of service, 
or both, under the provisions of subsection F of this section. In determining 
and setting a fee or terms and conditions of service, or both, under this act, 
other than an interim fee under the provisions of subsection F of this section, 
the Commission shall determine a fee or terms and conditions of service, or 
both, which would result from arm's-length bargaining in good faith in a 
competitive market between persons of equal bargaining power and shall consider 
all economically significant factors for gathering which it determines to be 
relevant which may include, but are not limited to:</P>
<P>1. The fees and terms and conditions of service which such gatherer receives 
from the complainant and other shippers for analogous levels of service for 
gathering within an area the Commission determines to be relevant;</P>
<P>2. The fees charged and the terms and conditions of service provided by other 
gatherers for gathering within an area the Commission determines to be 
relevant;</P>
<P>3. The reasonable financial risks of operating such a gathering system;</P>
<P>4. The reasonable capital, operating and maintenance costs of such a 
gathering system; and</P>
<P>5. Such other factors which the Commission determines to be relevant.</P>
<P>Provided, that neither such fee nor such terms and conditions of service 
shall be computed on a utility rate of return basis and that gatherers shall not 
be regulated like public utilities in the setting of fees and terms and 
conditions of service.</P>
<P>E. In establishing the gathering fee, if the Commission determines the 
natural gas is processed, the order entered by the Commission establishing such 
fee shall include the following:</P>
<P>1. Gatherer shall return to shipper at the redelivery point the MMBtus 
attributable to such shipper at the plant inlet, less any volumetric deductions 
for fuel and loss associated with gathering; and</P>
<P>2. For any month in which there is a spread fee, the shipper shall pay to the 
gatherer such amount.</P>
<P>No further order shall be made regarding the calculation of the spread fee or 
gatherers obligations for redelivery of natural gas or natural gas liquids.</P>
<P>F. Upon the filing of a complaint under this section which seeks to continue 
an existing gathering service, the Commission on motion of the complainant shall 
require continuation of gathering service under the fees and terms and 
conditions of service of the last expired contract, if any, during the pendency 
of the complaint, or set an interim fee and terms and conditions of service. 
However, the gatherer shall not be required to provide interim gathering if the 
gatherer can show that such continuance would require an otherwise unnecessary, 
material capital expenditure, or if the Commission determines interim gathering 
is excused for safety reasons. Interim relief shall be by order of the 
Commission after notice to the gatherer from whom gathering service is being 
requested and subsequent hearing. Any fees for gathering collected during the 
period a complaint which seeks to set a fee for such gathering is pending shall 
be subject to the fee finally set by the Commission. If the finally determined 
fee is less than the collected fee, the excess shall be refunded to the 
complainant within fifteen (15) days after the final determination of the fee, 
together with interest at a rate established by the Commission. If the finally 
determined fee is greater than the collected fee, the excess shall be paid by 
the complainant to the gatherer within fifteen (15) days after the fee is 
finally determined, together with interest at a rate established by the 
Commission.</P>
<P>G. A gatherer providing natural gas gathering services shall not increase the 
fee for gathering, change the terms or conditions of service, discontinue 
gathering service, or not renew an expiring contract of the shipper, without 
first giving the shipper written notice prior to the effective date of the 
increase in fee, change in terms or conditions of service, discontinuance of 
gathering services, or nonrenewal. Such written notice shall be given at least 
ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of such increase, change, 
discontinuance or nonrenewal, unless otherwise provided by existing contract, 
but in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such 
increase, change, discontinuance or nonrenewal with respect to contracts having 
terms in excess of six (6) months. If the parties are unable to agree upon 
continuation of service or fees or terms and conditions of service, or both, the 
aggrieved party may file a complaint under this act to determine whether an open 
access obligation exists and, if so, seek the determination of fees or terms and 
conditions of service, or both, under this act.</P>
<P>H. All matters to be determined by the Commission under this act shall be 
heard on an expedited basis and a final, appealable order rendered thereon 
within one hundred twenty (120) days from the filing of the complaint, unless 
otherwise agreed by the parties. The Commission shall have the power and 
authority to promulgate rules and issue orders to implement, administer, and 
enforce the provisions of this act and may exercise all incidental powers which 
are necessary and proper to the performance of its duties under this act. The 
Commission shall promulgate rules establishing a voluntary, nonbinding, informal 
procedure to be available, either before or after the filing of a complaint, in 
order to encourage the resolution of disputes arising under this act. An 
informal procedure shall not extend the time limit of one hundred twenty (120) 
days established in this subsection, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</P>
<P>I. Upon the filing of a complaint of an aggrieved party, the Commission shall 
have the right to require the production of relevant documents of the gatherer 
which is subject to the complaint. Gathering contracts covering the 25 wells 
most recently connected to the system of the gatherer which is subject to the 
complaint are deemed discoverable and production will not be denied upon a 
relevance objection. The Commission may issue process to enforce the attendance 
of any witness and to obtain any documents relevant to the complaint of an 
aggrieved party. The Commission may punish any person failing to obey or comply 
with any order or requirement under this act for contempt, and such person shall 
be subject to a civil penalty of not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) 
for each day that such noncompliance continues. If, after notice and opportunity 
to be heard, the Commission finds that the documents of any other gatherer are 
relevant, the Commission may issue process to enforce the attendance of any 
witness and to obtain any documents relevant to the complaint and may punish any 
person failing to obey or comply with any order or requirement under this act 
for contempt and such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more 
than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each day that such noncompliance 
continues. If, in connection with any proceeding under this act, any person, 
whether or not a party to the proceeding, furnishes information it desires to be 
confidential, proprietary and/or privileged, the Commission, upon motion of such 
person and upon a finding by the Commission that the information is 
confidential, proprietary or privileged, shall enter such protective order as 
may be necessary to ensure that the information will be used only as may be 
required for the proper determination of the merits of a proceeding under this 
act and will not be used for purposes of competitive advantage. Any person, 
whether or not a party to the proceeding, furnishing a contract or contracts in 
response to a request under this section shall, prior to furnishing such 
contracts, delete or obfuscate the names of all persons who are parties to the 
contract, any unit or well names contained in the contracts, and any reference 
to the section designation contained in the legal description of the location of 
the well or unit, but such person shall not remove references to the applicable 
township and range designations. Additional nonrelevant, confidential 
information may be deleted or obfuscated from contracts furnished in response to 
a request under this section, subject to Commission review. Documents produced 
under this section shall be covered by a confidentiality privilege and thus 
exempt from the Oklahoma Open Records Act.</P>
<P>J. The Commission shall maintain an index of all orders entered by it under 
this act identifying the date and order number, indicating the type of relief 
granted, and identifying the gatherer and gathering system to which the order 
applies. All orders of the Commission determining a fair, just, reasonable and 
nondiscriminatory fee and terms and conditions of service under this act shall 
contain findings of fact and conclusions of law in sufficient detail so that the 
relevant and significant factors considered by the Commission in determining a 
fee and terms and conditions of service, the Commission's analysis of those 
factors and the reasons supporting such fee and terms and conditions of service 
can be reasonably determined from the face of the order; provided, such order 
shall not include any information not permitted to be disclosed by the terms of 
any protective order entered under subsection I of this section.</P>
<P>K. No gatherer shall charge any fee or require any terms and conditions of 
service, or both, which unduly discriminate in favor of the gatherer's 
affiliated entities and against other persons. Each gatherer shall maintain 
documents in such a manner that gathering services provided to an affiliate may 
be identified and segregated.</P>
<P>L. Any person seeking gathering service for a well or wells covered by a 
previous order of the Commission may file an application with the Commission 
seeking the same fee or terms and conditions of service as provided in the 
previous order, which shall be granted to the applicant by the Commission, 
unless the gatherer can demonstrate that the applicant is not a similarly 
situated shipper or that there has been a material change in conditions or 
circumstances since the prior fee or terms and conditions of service were 
determined.</P>
<P>M. Nothing in this act shall create or be interpreted to create service or 
abandonment obligations upon a gatherer or give the Commission jurisdiction to 
regulate abandonment of gathering facilities. Nothing in this act shall give the 
Commission jurisdiction to regulate the purchase, processing or resale of 
natural gas or the price or other compensation for, or any of the other terms or 
conditions of any such purchase, processing or resale.</P>
