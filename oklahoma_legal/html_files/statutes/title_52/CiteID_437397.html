<p>A. &nbsp;No person, firm or corporation shall manufacture, fabricate, assemble or install in this state any system, container, apparatus or appliance used or to be used in this state in or for the transportation, storage, dispensing or utilization of LPG, nor shall any transporter, distributor or retailer of LPG store, dispense or transport over the highways of this state any LPG intended for use in this state in any such system, container, apparatus or appliance, without having first applied for and obtained a registration permit to do so. &nbsp;A permit shall not be required by any person, firm or corporation engaged in the production or manufacture of LPG, or selling or reselling LPG to transporters, gas processors, distributors or retailers, nor by any person, firm or corporation selling or delivering motor vehicles or tractors which are factory equipped with an LPG system, container, apparatus or appliance for the utilization of LPG as motor fuel. &nbsp;The provisions of this section shall not prevent an individual from installing in his or her own single-unit residence any system, container, apparatus or appliance which uses or will utilize LPG, provided that such individual has secured an inspection of the installation by the Administrator or someone designated by the Administrator or by a person duly licensed to make such an installation prior to the use of the system, container, apparatus or appliance. &nbsp;Applications for registration permits shall be in writing, on a form provided by the Board, and shall contain such pertinent information as is required by the Board. &nbsp;Upon approval of each application and receipt of the certificates of insurance or securities required by the provisions of this section, the Administrator shall issue to the applicant a permit to engage in the phase of the LPG industry in this state to which such permit applies. &nbsp;No permit other than the Class I Dealer Permit shall be transferable. &nbsp;The Board is authorized to establish a fee for the transfer of a Class I Permit. &nbsp;Nothing in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=80805">Sections 420.1</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=80820">420.15</a> of this title shall be construed to regulate the manufacturing, fabrication, assembling, selling or installing of any system, container, apparatus or appliance having a fuel container with a maximum individual water capacity of less than two and one-half (2 1/2) pounds.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;The Board is authorized to establish an annual permit fee for the issuance of each class of permit listed in subsection C of this section.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;All such registration permits shall expire annually with no permit extending longer than one (1) calendar year. &nbsp;The expiration dates shall be set by the Board in the rules. &nbsp;The Administrator may issue a semiannual permit to applicants engaging in the business within six (6) months or less of the annual renewal date. &nbsp;A semiannual permit shall expire on the following annual expiration date. &nbsp;The fee for a semiannual permit shall be one-half (1/2) that of the fee of the annual permit. &nbsp;All registration permits required pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be renewed upon payment of the annual fees on or before the expiration of the registration permit, and upon fulfilling all insurance requirements. &nbsp;The Board is authorized to establish necessary penalty provisions required to ensure prompt payment of the annual fees.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;No application shall be approved by the Board unless the Board is satisfied by adequate written examination of the applicant, or the individual who is or shall be directly responsible for actively supervising the operations of such applicant which is a partnership, firm or corporation, that the applicant or such individual has a working knowledge of the safety requirements provided by the rules of the Board. &nbsp;The Board shall cause to be held public hearings in the months of January, April, July and October of each year on all applications for new registration permits required by the provisions of this section, or upon such other occasions as the Board may deem necessary. &nbsp;Notice of each hearing shall be mailed to each such applicant and shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the Office of the Administrator in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the hearing. &nbsp;The notice shall include the name, address, permit class and business location of each applicant whose application is to be considered at the hearing. &nbsp;The applicant, or the individual who is or shall be directly responsible for and actively supervising the operations of the applicant, may be present at the hearing. &nbsp;If, after the public hearing, an applicant is found by the Board to have a working knowledge of the safety requirements provided by the rules and regulations of the Board, the Board shall cause an order to that effect to be entered upon its records and the application shall be approved. &nbsp;In the event an applicant fails to qualify, the fact shall be entered upon the Board's records.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;The Board shall charge a fee, in an amount established by the Board, for testing materials and the expense of holding the examinations provided for in this section. &nbsp;The fee shall be paid upon filing an application for any permit.</p>

<p>H. &nbsp;A registration permit shall not be issued to any applicant unless the Administrator has received certificates of insurance or security as required by this section.</p>

<p>J. &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided for in this section, all transporters, distributors, or retailers of LPG in this state, required to be registered pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=80805">Sections 420.1</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=80820">420.15</a> of this title, shall file with the Administrator a certificate indicating that public liability and property damage insurance coverage has been issued. &nbsp;The Board is authorized to establish coverage amounts for each class of permit, provided coverage shall be for an amount of not less than Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) to Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) for bodily injury and limits of not less than Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) for property damage has been issued, and is in full force and effect, covering the plant, equipment, and motor vehicles used in such business, and the operations of the business.</p>

<p>L. &nbsp;The Board is authorized, upon proof of or a satisfactory showing that any person, firm or corporation is financially able to pay or satisfy any judgment, claim or demand against the person, firm or corporation, to waive the insurance coverage required by this section. &nbsp;The Board, in lieu of the certificate, may require the deposit, with the Administrator, of securities, or satisfactory indemnity bond, in an amount and of a kind designated by the Board, to secure the liability of such person, firm or corporation to pay any judgment, claim or demand. &nbsp;The security shall not be in excess of the limits set forth in this section. &nbsp;If the Board deems the financial status of such person, firm or corporation to be impaired so as to reduce the ability of such person, firm or corporation to make payment or to satisfy any judgment, claim or demand, the Board may revoke the waiver and require the person, firm or corporation to file certificates required by this section within thirty (30) days after written notice is sent by the Board to the person, firm or corporation.</p>
