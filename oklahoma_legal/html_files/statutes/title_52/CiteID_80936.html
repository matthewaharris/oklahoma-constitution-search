<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Within sixty (60) days after receiving a written 
request from the operator, each working interest owner in a well producing gas 
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the operator a written statement 
showing the name, address, royalty interest, taxpayer identification number and 
payment status of owners of royalty interest to which such working interest is 
subject. Thereafter, each working interest owner shall furnish or cause to be 
furnished to the operator a written statement showing:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Changes in the above specified information within 
sixty (60) days of receipt of notification thereof; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Changes in its working interests within sixty (60) 
days of the receipt of notice of the change.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Each producing owner of gas from a well shall 
provide to the operator no later than five (5) business days prior to the month 
in which the nomination is to be effective, but earlier if required by the first 
purchaser or transporter, the name of the first purchaser or shipper and the 
volumes of gas nominated for production for such producing owner's account. The 
term "shipper", as used in this section, shall include any entity who contracts 
with a transporter to move gas through the transporter's system. The owner of 
the gas meter shall confirm all nominations with the operator of the well no 
later than the last business day prior to the month in which production 
occurs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Within sixty (60) days after the end of the month 
of production, each producing owner shall report and account to the operator of 
the well, the identity of the first purchaser or shipper of the gas and the 
information specified in Section 570.12 of this title. Within thirty (30) days 
after receiving notice of any retroactive gas volume adjustment, each producing 
owner shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, notice of such retroactive 
adjustment to the operator of the well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. Within fifteen (15) days after the end of the 
month of production, each owner of a gas meter taking gas solely from a 
gathering system shall provide upon first request by the owner of such gathering 
system and thereafter, the gross volume of gas measured by such meter both in 
MCF and British Thermal Unit equivalent.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Within twenty (20) days after the end of the month of 
production, each owner of a gas meter shall provide or cause to be provided in 
writing to the operator of the well, the gross volume of gas measured by such 
meter, both in MCF and British Thermal Unit equivalent, and the volume of gas 
allocated at the meter to each first purchaser or shipper and each contracted 
producing owner that sold gas to the owner of the gas meter. Each meter owner 
shall, within the same time period, furnish each first purchaser or shipper the 
volume of gas allocated at the meter to that first purchaser or shipper. 
However, in the event a gas processing plant operator is performing the 
allocations, within ten (10) days after the end of the production month, the 
pipeline residue gas meter owner shall provide, upon first request by the 
processing plant operator and thereafter, the volume and British Thermal Unit 
equivalent measured through its meter as required by the gas processing plant 
operator for its allocations under this subsection.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The owner of a gas meter who has a gas contract, 
whether one or more, with one or more producing owners covering all of the gas 
flowing through its gas meter, may, as an alternative to supplying the operator 
with the information stated in this subsection, furnish monthly volume 
statements to the operator of the well, provided it has already furnished the 
operator with the names of the producing owners and the decimal interest owned 
by each such producing owner or any method other than by decimal interest then 
in effect for allocating gas among the producing owners. Thereafter, the owner 
of the gas meter shall only be required to supply the operator with changes to 
the name of a producing owner, the decimal interest owned by a producing owner 
or the method, other than by decimal interest, for allocating gas among the 
producing owners within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such 
change.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of any 
retroactive gas volume adjustment, each owner of a gas meter shall furnish 
notice of such retroactive adjustment to the operator of the well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. Within thirty-five (35) days after the end of the 
month of production each first purchaser or shipper of gas from a gas meter 
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the operator of the well, a volume 
allocation statement showing the volume of gas purchased from or shipped for 
each contracted producing owner. Within thirty (30) days after making any 
retroactive gas volume adjustment for such well, the first purchaser or shipper 
shall furnish notice of such retroactive gas volume adjustment to the operator 
of the well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Any owner of a gas meter, first purchaser, or any 
gas shipper that does not provide the information required under subsection D or 
E of this section shall subject the producing owner or owners contracted to such 
entity to the same remedies available to the operator under subsection H of this 
section, as if such producing owner or owners are in noncompliance with 
subsections A and C of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. For production occurring after August 31, 1992, 
each person distributing proceeds to a royalty interest owner shall maintain for 
a period of not less than five (5) years:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Copies of information furnished to the operator 
pursuant to the Production Revenue Standards Act; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A record of receipts and payments of proceeds 
which have occurred pursuant to the Production Revenue Standards Act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Such records shall be available for inspection upon 
reasonable notice by any affected royalty interest owner in the well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. The Production Revenue Standards Act shall not 
supersede or limit the operator's right to control gas nominations and 
allocations pursuant to the provisions of any joint operating agreement, gas 
balancing agreement or other agreement then in effect between the operator of 
the well and any producing owner, or any order of the Oklahoma Corporation 
Commission. If the operator of the well is not provided with the information set 
forth in subsections A and C of this section within the sixty-day period set 
forth in each said subsection, the operator of the well shall have the right, 
but not the obligation, to confirm zero volume of gas sales for such 
noncomplying producing owner and to make available for nomination and sale to 
the producing owners in the well then in compliance with the provisions of 
subsections A and C of this section, all of the noncomplying producing owner's 
share of production for the next subsequent calendar month of production and for 
each and every month thereafter during which such producing owner is in 
noncompliance with provisions of subsections A and C of this section. If the 
operator elects to make the noncomplying producing owner's share of production 
available for nomination and sale, the operator shall immediately notify the 
noncomplying producing owner, by certified mail, that it shall no longer have 
the right to nominate any volume of gas until it is in compliance with the 
provisions of subsections A and C of this section, or its first purchaser, 
shipper or owner of the gas meter are in compliance with subsections D and E of 
this section. Such notice shall contain the following information:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Lease or well identification;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Legal location; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Production months of noncompliance with 
subsections A, C, D or E of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The operator shall then immediately notify each 
producing owner then in compliance with subsections A and C of this section that 
additional gas may be available for nomination and sale. The operator shall also 
immediately notify in writing the noncomplying producing owner's first purchaser 
or shipper and the owner of the gas meter that the producing owner, first 
purchaser, shipper or owner of the gas meter is in noncompliance with the 
provisions of subsections A, C, D or E of this section and thus does not have 
the right to nominate and sell or transport any volume of gas until it is in 
compliance with this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The first purchaser or shipper and the owner of the 
gas meter shall be entitled to rely on and shall incorporate on a prospective 
basis any nomination or allocation changes pursuant to such notification from 
the operator under this section. Changes pursuant to such notification can be 
made on a retroactive basis if so agreed to by the operator, owner of the meter, 
and first purchaser or shipper.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As soon as a noncomplying party is in compliance with 
the provisions of this section, but no sooner than the next production month 
unless otherwise agreed to, the operator of the well shall give the affected 
producing owner the opportunity to nominate and sell gas subject to existing 
agreements or by common practice within the oil and gas industry.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Any noncomplying party that disagrees with the 
information contained in the operator's written notice required under this 
subsection shall have the right to challenge the operator's actions pursuant to 
the provisions of subsection J of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. All elections and notices given pursuant to the 
provisions of the Production Revenue Standards Act shall become effective as of 
the first day of the month following the end of any time period specified in the 
Production Revenue Standards Act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. The remedies provided for in this section shall 
not preclude any party from pursuing the remedies available to it through the 
district courts, as provided by existing law, including the right to 
offset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. Nothing contained in the Natural Gas Market 
Sharing Act shall change the obligations of a purchaser under an existing gas 
contract unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.</FONT></P><B><I>
