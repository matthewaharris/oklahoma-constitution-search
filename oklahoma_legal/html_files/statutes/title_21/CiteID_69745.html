<p>1. Any structure, building, or office space which is owned or leased by a city, town, county, state, or federal governmental authority for the purpose of conducting business with the public;</p>

<p>2. Any courthouse, courtroom, prison, jail, detention facility, or any facility used to process, hold, or house arrested persons, prisoners, or persons alleged delinquent or adjudicated delinquent, except as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=83631">Section 21 of Title 57</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes;</p>

<p>3. Any public or private elementary or public or private secondary school, except as provided in subsections C and D of this section;</p>

<p>4. Any publicly owned or operated sports arena or venue during a professional sporting event, unless allowed by the event holder;</p>

<p>5. Any place where gambling is authorized by law, unless allowed by the property owner;</p>

<p>6. Any other place specifically prohibited by law; and</p>

<p>7. Any property set aside by a county, city, town, public trust with a county, city, or town as a beneficiary, or state governmental authority for an event that is secured with minimum security provisions. For purposes of this paragraph, a minimum security provision consists of a location that is secured utilizing the following:</p>

<p>a. a metallic-style security fence that is at least eight (8) feet in height that encompasses the property and is secured in such a way as to deter unauthorized entry,</p>

<p>b. controlled access points staffed by a uniformed, commissioned peace officer, and</p>

<p>c. a metal detector whereby persons walk or otherwise travel with their property through or by the metal detector.</p>

<p>5. Any property set aside by a public or private elementary or secondary school for the use or parking of any vehicle, whether attended or unattended; provided, however, the firearm shall be stored and hidden from view in a locked motor vehicle when the motor vehicle is left unattended on school property; and</p>

<p>Nothing contained in any provision of this subsection or subsection C of this section shall be construed to authorize or allow any person in control of any place described in subsection A of this section to establish any policy or rule that has the effect of prohibiting any person in lawful possession of a handgun license or otherwise in lawful possession of a firearm from carrying or possessing the firearm on the property described in this subsection.</p>

Except for acts of gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct, a governing entity of a private school that adopts a policy which authorizes the possession of a weapon on private school property, a school bus, or a vehicle used by the private school shall not be subject to liability for any injuries arising from the adoption of the policy. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to claims pursuant to the Administrative Workers Compensation Act.</p>

<p>2. Hold a valid reserve peace officer certification as provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=454176">Section 3311 of Title 70</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>E. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, on any property designated as a municipal zoo or park of any size that is owned, leased, operated, or managed by:</p>

<p>1. A public trust created pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=438402">Section 176 of Title 60</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes; or</p>

<p>The college, university, or technology center school may notify the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation within ten (10) days of a violation of any provision of this subsection by a licensee.

<p>Nothing contained in any provision of this subsection shall be construed to authorize or allow any college, university, or technology center school to establish any policy or rule that has the effect of prohibiting any person in lawful possession of a handgun license or any person in lawful possession of a firearm, machete, blackjack, loaded cane, hand chain, or metal knuckles from possession of a firearm, machete, blackjack, loaded cane, hand chain, or metal knuckles in places described in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of this subsection. Nothing contained in any provision of this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of any college, university, or technology center school in this state from taking administrative action against any student for any violation of any provision of this subsection.</p>
