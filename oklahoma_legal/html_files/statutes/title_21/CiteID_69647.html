<p>d. entering onto or remaining on property owned, leased, or occupied by that individual,</p>

<p>e. contacting that individual by telephone,</p>

<p>f. sending mail or electronic communications to that individual, and</p>

<p>G. Any pleas of guilty or nolo contendere or finding of guilt to a violation of any provision of this section shall constitute a conviction of the offense for the purpose of any subsection of this section under which the existence of a prior conviction is relevant for a period of ten (10) years following the completion of any sentence or court imposed probationary term.</p>
