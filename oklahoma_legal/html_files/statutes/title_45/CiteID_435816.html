<P>A. It shall be unlawful for any operator to engage in any mining operations 
in this state without first obtaining a permit or a Limited Use Permit from the 
Department of Mines for each separate mining operation. The Department shall 
determine what constitutes a separate mining operation by rules promulgated 
under the Mining Lands Reclamation Act.</P>
<P>B. Any operator desiring to engage in limited mining activity may apply for a 
Limited Use Permit for those mining operations not eligible for a surface mining 
permit. Application for such permit shall be made upon forms furnished by the 
Department. The form shall contain a description of the tract or tracts of land 
and shall include the section, township, range and county in which the land is 
located. A map shall be attached to the application which accurately outlines 
and locates the tract of land. A statement that the applicant has the right and 
power by legal estate owned to mine the land so described shall be included with 
the application. In addition, the following conditions and requirements shall 
apply to Limited Use Permits:</P>
<P>1. The maximum acreage shall be restricted to two (2) acres;</P>
<P>2. The term of a Limited Use Permit shall not exceed twelve (12) months from 
the date of issuance;</P>
<P>3. A Limited Use Permit shall not carry a right of successive renewal;</P>
<P>4. A Limited Use Permit site must be reclaimed as required by Section 725 of 
this title within six (6) months following the expiration of the permit 
term;</P>
<P>5. A three-thousand-five-hundred-dollar reclamation bond must be filed with 
the Department prior to issuance of the permit;</P>
<P>6. Failure to reclaim the site disturbance within the permitted time frame or 
revocation of the Limited Use Permit will be cause for bond forfeiture or other 
action as may be ordered by the Department;</P>
<P>7. The use of processing equipment shall not be approved for a Limited Use 
Permit;</P>
<P>8. The use of explosives shall not be approved under a Limited Use 
Permit;</P>
<P>9. A processing fee of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) shall accompany the 
application for a Limited Use Permit; and</P>
<P>10. Mining production shall be reported and paid as required by Section 931 
of this title.</P>
<P>If the above listed conditions and requirements are met, the Department may 
issue a Limited Use Permit which shall not be subject to the notice and 
publication requirements as otherwise required by this section.</P>
<P>C. 1. Any operator desiring to engage in surface mining shall make written 
application to the Department for a permit. Application for such permit shall be 
made upon a form furnished by the Department. The form shall contain a 
description of the tract or tracts of land and the estimated number of acres to 
be affected by surface mining by the operator. The description shall include the 
section, township, range and county in which the land is located and shall 
otherwise describe the land with sufficient certainty so that it may be located 
and distinguished from other lands.</P>
<P>2. Transmission lines shall be plotted on a location map submitted with the 
application. A statement that the operator has the right and power by legal 
estate owned to mine by surface mining the land so described shall be included 
with the application.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>D. 1. Any operator desiring to engage in underground mining shall make 
written application to the Department for a permit. Application for such permit 
shall be made upon a form furnished by the Department. The form shall contain a 
description of the tract or tracts of land to be used as refuse disposal areas. 
The description shall include the section, township, range and county in which 
the land is located and shall otherwise describe the land with sufficient 
certainty so that it may be located and distinguished from other lands.</P>
<P>2. A statement that the applicant has the right and power by legal estate 
owned to use the land so described as a refuse disposal area shall be included 
with the application.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>E. Each application for a permit under subsections C and D of this section 
shall be accompanied by a plan of reclamation of the affected land that meets 
the requirements of the Mining Lands Reclamation Act. The application shall set 
forth the proposed use to be made of the affected land, the grading to be 
accomplished, the type of revegetation, and shall include the approximate time 
of grading and initial revegetation effort.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>F. Each application for a permit under subsections C and D of this section 
shall be accompanied by the bond or security meeting the requirements of Section 
728 of this title, or proof that such bond or security is still in effect, and a 
fee of One Hundred Seventy-five Dollars ($175.00) for each permit year, payable 
at the rate of One Hundred Seventy-five Dollars ($175.00) per year on the 
anniversary date of the year in which the permit or permit renewal was issued. 
All application fees shall be submitted to the State Treasurer, who shall 
deposit them in the Department of Mines Revolving Fund.</P>
<P>G. 1. Upon the receipt of such application, bond or security and fee due from 
the operator, the Department may issue a permit to the applicant which shall 
entitle the applicant to engage in mining on the land therein described in 
accordance with the rules promulgated by the Department, for the life expectancy 
of the operation unless the operator is in violation of any state statute or 
rule of the Department in which case the Department shall take appropriate 
action against the operator.</P>
<P>2. All applications for renewal of existing permits shall be filed prior to 
the expiration of the existing permit in accordance with the rules promulgated 
by the Department.</P>
<P>3. No permit shall be issued except upon proper application and public 
hearing, if requested.</P>
<P>H. 1. a. Upon filing the application with the Department, the applicant shall 
place an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of 
the mining operation, containing such information as is required by the 
Department, at least once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks.</P>
<P>b. The advertisement shall contain, at a minimum, the following:</P>
<P>(1) the name and business address of the applicant,</P>
<P>(2) a description which clearly shows or describes the precise location and 
boundaries of the proposed permit area and is sufficient to enable local 
residents to readily identify the proposed permit area. It may include towns, 
bodies of water, local landmarks, and any other information which would identify 
the location,</P>
<P>(3) the location where a copy of the application is available for public 
inspection,</P>
<P>(4) the name and address of the Department where written comments, 
objections, or requests for informal conferences on the application may be 
submitted pursuant to subsection P of this section,</P>
<P>(5) if an applicant seeks a permit to mine which includes relocation or 
closing of a public road, a copy of the county resolution pertaining to the 
affected county road, and</P>
<P>(6) such other information as is required by the Department.</P>
<P>2. Any property owner or resident of an occupied dwelling who may be 
adversely affected located within one (1) mile of the mining operation shall 
have the right to protest the issuance of a permit and request a public 
hearing.</P>
<P>3. The Department shall notify the surface owners of any hearings in 
connection with applications or permits in the same manner as the operator is 
notified.</P>
<P>4. Such protests must be received by the Department within fourteen (14) days 
after the date of publication of the newspaper advertisement. If a public 
hearing is requested, the Department shall then hold an informal hearing in the 
vicinity of the proposed mining.</P>
<P>5. Upon completion of findings after the hearing, the Department shall 
determine whether to issue or deny the permit, and shall notify all parties of 
its decision.</P>
<P>6. Any decision regarding the issuance of a permit under this section shall 
be appealable when entered, as provided in the Administrative Procedures 
Act.</P>
<P>I. Each application for a new operation shall contain, where applicable, a 
list of all other licenses and permits needed by the applicant to conduct the 
proposed mining operation. This list shall identify each license and permit 
by:</P>
<P>1. Type of permit or license;</P>
<P>2. Name and address of issuing authority;</P>
<P>3. Identification number or a copy of the application for permits or licenses 
or, if issued, a copy of the permit or license; and</P>
<P>4. If a decision has been made, the date of approval or disapproval by each 
issuing authority.</P>
<P>An existing operation which does not have on file a list of the applicable 
licenses or permits with the Department on the date of enactment of this act 
shall not be out of compliance with the provisions of this section. Any renewal 
of an existing permit or expansion or amendment to an existing operation upon 
time of application shall submit a copy of all approved licenses and permits 
issued by other agencies or jurisdictions.</P>
<P>Identifications of all permits and licenses shall include local government 
agencies with jurisdiction over or an interest in the area of the proposed 
mining operation including, but not limited to, planning agencies, water and 
sewer authorities; and all state and federal government agencies with authority 
to issue permits and licenses applicable to the proposed mining operation, 
including all state environmental agencies, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service district 
office, and federal fish and wildlife agencies.</P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>J. An operator desiring to have such operator's permit amended to cover 
additional land may file an amended application with the Department. Upon 
receipt of the amended application, and such additional bond as may be required 
under the provisions of the Mining Lands Reclamation Act, the Department shall 
issue an amendment to the original permit covering the additional land described 
in the amended application, without the payment of any additional fee.</P>
<P>K. An operator may withdraw any land covered by a permit, deleting affected 
land therefrom, by notifying the Department, in which case the penalty of the 
bond or security filed by such operator pursuant to the provisions of the Mining 
Lands Reclamation Act shall be reduced proportionately.</P>
<P>L. Permits issued to an operator may be transferable to another operator, 
provided the new operator can demonstrate to the Department, prior to the 
transfer of ownership, that conditions and obligations required for the permit 
will be met and the new operator has submitted a performance bond or other 
guarantee, or has obtained the bond coverage of the original permittee.</P>
<P>M. The perimeter of the permit area shall be clearly marked by durable and 
recognizable markers or by other means approved by the Department.</P>
<P>N. The Department shall determine the blasting distance to transmission lines 
by rule.</P>
<P>O. 1. If any mining operations where blasting is required occur within the 
limits of a municipality with a population in excess of three hundred thousand 
(300,000) according to the latest Federal Decennial Census or within the limits 
of a municipality within a county with a population in excess of three hundred 
thousand (300,000) according to the latest Federal Decennial Census, the 
application for a permit pursuant to subsections C and D of this section shall 
be accompanied by proof that the operator is in full compliance with all 
applicable regulations of the municipality. Certified copies of any required 
municipal permits and any other required written municipal approvals shall be 
attached to the application when submitted to the Department. No mining permit 
shall be issued by the Department unless the applicant first complies with the 
requirements of this subsection. A municipality is not required to reconsider 
requests denied by the municipality related to the same site unless the 
municipality determines there has been a material change in the application.</P>
<P>2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not apply to 
existing permitted operations, revisions or amendments thereto, or any 
application on file with the Department prior to May 25, 2005. In addition, the 
provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not apply to any future 
operation on property directly adjacent to property on which a permitted 
operation is located, provided that the operation is permitted and the adjacent 
property is owned or leased by the operator on the effective date of this act. 
For purposes of this subsection, properties separated by a public road shall be 
considered to be adjacent. </P><STRIKE></STRIKE>
<P>P. Within a reasonable time, as established by the Department, written 
comments or objections on permit or bond release applications may be submitted 
to the Department by public entities including but not limited to the local soil 
conservation district, with respect to the effects of the proposed mining 
operations on the environment.</P>
<P>Q. Any person having an interest in or who is or may be adversely affected by 
the decision on a permit or bond release application, or any federal, state or 
local agency, shall have the right to request in writing that the Department 
hold an informal conference on the application. The Department shall hold the 
informal conference within a reasonable time following the receipt of the 
written request at a location in the vicinity of the proposed or active surface 
mining or reclamation operation.</P>
