<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Interstate Mining Compact is hereby entered into 
by this state with any and all other states legally joining therein in 
accordance with its terms, in the form substantially as follows:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE I. <BR>FINDING AND 
PURPOSES</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The party states find that:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Mining and the contributions thereof to the 
economy and well-being of every state are of basic significance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The effects of mining on the availability of land, 
water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly 
can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of 
those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for 
other purposes, and the public.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects 
of mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the devising of 
means to deal with them are of both public and private concern.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Such variables as soil structure and composition, 
physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make 
impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the 
conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of 
mineral and other natural resources; but justifiable requirements of law and 
practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources 
may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from 
state to state for all mining operations similarly situated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The states are in a position and have the 
responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound 
conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The purposes of this compact are to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Advance the protection and restoration of land, 
water and other resources affected by mining.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or 
counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable 
to mining.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant 
regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states 
which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving 
the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct 
of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Assist the party states in their efforts to 
facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such 
use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and 
to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the 
improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other 
resources.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient 
and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits 
attributable to mining.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE II. <BR>DEFINITIONS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As used in this compact, the term:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) "Mining" means the breaking of the surface soil 
in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, 
ores, or other solid matter; any activity or process constituting all or part of 
a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid 
matter from its original location; and the preparation, washing, cleaning or 
other treatment of minerals, ores or other solid matter so as to make them 
suitable for commercial, industrial or construction use; but shall not include 
those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and 
shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of on site 
farming or construction.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) "State" means a State of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a Territory or 
Possession of the United States.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE III. <BR>STATE 
PROGRAMS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Each party state agrees that within a reasonable time 
it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and 
use of mined land, by the establishment of standards, enactment of laws or the 
continuing of the same in force, to accomplish:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The protection of the public and the protection of 
adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and 
other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the 
abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such 
operations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse 
and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the 
economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of land and 
water.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The institution and maintenance of suitable 
programs for adaptation, restoration and rehabilitation of mined 
lands.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The prevention, abatement and control of water, 
air and soil pollution resulting from mining, present, past and 
future.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IV. <BR>POWERS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In addition to any other powers conferred upon the 
Interstate Mining Commission, established by Article V of this compact, such 
Commission shall have power to:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Study mining operations, processes and techniques 
for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, 
processes and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, 
recreation and patterns of community or regional development or 
change.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement 
and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Make recommendations concerning any aspect or 
aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters 
within the purview of this compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Gather and disseminate information relating to any 
of the matters within the purview of this compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Cooperate with the federal government and any 
public or private entities having interests in any subject coming within the 
purview of this compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Consult, upon the request of a party state and 
within resources available therefor, with the officials of such state in respect 
to any problem within the purview of this compact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Study and make recommendations with respect to any 
practice, process, technique, or course of action that may improve the 
efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Study and make recommendations relating to the 
safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become the subject of 
mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of 
mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land 
and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or 
potential mining sites.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE V. <BR>THE COMMISSION</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) There is hereby created an agency of the party 
states to be known as the "Interstate Mining Commission", hereinafter called 
"the Commission". The Commission shall be composed of one commissioner from each 
party state who shall be the Governor thereof. Pursuant to the laws of his party 
state, each Governor shall have the assistance of an advisory body (including 
membership from mining industries, conservation interests and such other public 
and private interests as may be appropriate) in considering problems relating to 
mining and in discharging his responsibilities as the commissioner of his state 
on the Commission. In any instance where a Governor is unable to attend a 
meeting of the Commission or perform any other function in connection with the 
business of the Commission, he shall designate an alternate, from among the 
members of the advisory body required by this paragraph, who shall represent him 
and act in his place and stead. The designation of an alternate shall be 
communicated by the Governor to the Commission in such manner as its bylaws may 
provide.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The commissioners shall be entitled to one vote 
each on the Commission. No action of the Commission making a recommendation 
pursuant to Articles IV-3, IV-7 and IV-8 or requesting, accepting or disposing 
of funds, services or other property pursuant to this paragraph, Articles V(g), 
V(h), or VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the 
total number of votes on the Commission is cast in favor thereof. All other 
action shall be by a majority of those present and voting: provided that action 
of the Commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the 
commissioners, or their alternates, is present. The Commission may establish and 
maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its 
business. The Commission may acquire, hold and convey real and personal property 
and any interest therein.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The Commission shall have a seal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The Commission shall elect annually, from among 
its members, a Chairman, a Vice Chairman and a Treasurer. The Commission shall 
appoint an Executive Director and fix his duties and compensation. Such 
Executive Director shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission. The Executive 
Director, the Treasurer and such other personnel as the Commission shall 
designate shall be bonded. The amount or amounts of such bond or bonds shall be 
determined by the Commission.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or 
other merit system laws of any of the party states, the Executive Director with 
the approval of the Commission, shall appoint, remove or discharge such 
personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the Commission's functions, 
and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(f) The Commission may establish and maintain 
independently or in conjunction with a party state, a suitable retirement system 
for its employees. Employees of the Commission shall be eligible for social 
security coverage in respect of old-age and survivor's insurance provided that 
the Commission takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to the laws of the 
United States, to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental 
agency or unit. The Commission may establish and maintain or participate in such 
additional programs of employee benefits as it may deem appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(g) The Commission may borrow, accept or contract for 
the services of personnel from any state, the United States or any other 
governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association or 
corporation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(h) The Commission may accept for any of its purposes 
and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, 
equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any 
state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, 
firm, association or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the 
same. Any donation or grant accepted by the Commission pursuant to this 
paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (g) of this article shall 
be reported in the annual report of the Commission. Such report shall include 
the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant or services 
borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(i) The Commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct 
of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The 
Commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy 
thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or 
officer in each of the party states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(j) The Commission annually shall make to the 
Governor, Legislature and advisory body required by Article V(a) of each party 
state a report covering the activities of the Commission for the preceding year, 
and embodying such recommendations as may have been made by the Commission. The 
Commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VI. <BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>ADVISORY, TECHNICAL AND </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>REGIONAL 
COMMITTEES</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Commission shall establish such advisory, 
technical and regional committees as it may deem necessary, membership on which 
shall include private persons and public officials and shall cooperate with and 
use the services of any such committees and the organizations which the members 
represent in furthering any of its activities. Such committees may be formed to 
consider problems of special interest to any party states, problems dealing with 
particular commodities or types of mining operations, problems related to 
reclamation, development, or use of mined land, or any other matters of concern 
to the Commission.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VII. <BR>FINANCE</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The Commission shall submit to the Governor or 
designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated 
expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state 
for presentation to the legislature thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Each of the Commission's budgets of estimated 
expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to 
be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations 
requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as 
follows: one-half in equal shares; and the remainder in proportion to the value 
of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined. In determining such values, the 
Commission shall employ such available public source or sources of information 
as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among 
the party states. Each of the Commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and 
requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in 
obtaining information concerning value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter 
mined.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any 
party state. The Commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part 
with funds available to it under Article V(h) of this compact: provided that the 
Commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any 
obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the 
Commission makes use of funds available to it under Article V(h) hereof, the 
Commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the 
party states adequate to meet the same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of 
all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Commission 
shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its 
bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall 
be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit 
shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the 
Commission.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) The accounts of the Commission shall be open at 
any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party 
states and by any persons authorized by the Commission.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to 
prevent Commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of 
accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the 
Commission.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE VIII. <BR></FONT><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>ENTRY INTO FORCE </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>AND 
WITHDRAWAL</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) This compact shall enter into force when enacted 
into law by any four or more states. Thereafter, this compact shall become 
effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by 
enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect 
until one (1) year after the Governor of the withdrawing state has given notice 
in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No 
withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a 
party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE IX. <BR>EFFECT ON OTHER 
LAWS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit, 
repeal or supersede any other law of any party state.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>ARTICLE X. <BR>CONSTRUCTION AND 
SEVERABILITY</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to 
effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be 
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is 
declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States 
or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance 
is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the 
applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall 
not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the 
constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full 
force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect 
as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</FONT></P><B><I>
