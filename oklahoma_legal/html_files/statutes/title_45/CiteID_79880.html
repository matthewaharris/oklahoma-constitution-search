affected area, permit area, or mine plan area, depending on the context in which 
"adjacent area" is used, where air, surface or ground water, fish, wildlife, 
vegetation or other resources protected by this act may be adversely impacted by 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. "Affected area" means, with respect to surface 
mining activities, any land or water upon or in which those activities are

complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls, 
spoil piles and coal refuse piles eliminated. Water impoundments may be 
permitted where the regulatory authority determines that they are in compliance 
with Section 745.18 of this title and applicable rules and 
regulations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. "Aquifer" means a zone, stratum, or group of 
strata confined or unconfined, including perched conditions, that can store and

deputy or representative of the Chief Mine Inspector as shall be designated by 
the Chief Mine Inspector to perform any actions required by this act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>14. "Disturbed area" means an area where vegetation, 
topsoil, or overburden is removed by surface coal mining operations or upon 
which topsoil, spoil, coal processing waste or noncoal waste is placed. Those 
areas are "disturbed" until reclamation of those areas is complete and the bond 
or other assurance of performance is released.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>15. "Diversion" means a channel, embankment, or other 
manmade structure constructed for the purpose of diverting the flow of water 
from one area to another:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. Permanent diversion means a diversion remaining 
after surface coal mining and reclamation are completed and which has been 
approved for retention by the Department and other appropriate state and federal 
agencies,</FONT></P>

fill to the top of the fill is greater than ten (10) degrees. In fills with less 
than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) cubic yards of material, associated 
with contour mining, the top surface of the fill will be at the elevation of the 
coal seam. In all other head-of-hollow fills, the top surface of the fill, when 
completed, is at approximately the same elevation as the adjacent ridge line, 
and no significant area of natural drainage occurs above the fill draining into

precipitation, runoff, evaporation, and the change in ground and surface water 
storage.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>21. "Hydrologic regime" means the entire state of 
water movement in a given area. It is a function of the climate, and includes 
the phenomena by which water first occurs as atmospheric water vapor, passes

and erosion characteristics, and which historically have been used for intensive 
agricultural purposes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>37. "Reclamation" means, through the process of 
backfilling, regrading, topsoil replacement, reutilization, and revegetation 
activities, the bringing back of land to its approximate original contours and 
configuration, and resulting in an equal or better land use category, and shall 
be consistent with the existing surrounding environment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>38. "Reference areas" means land units of varying 
size and shape identified and maintained under appropriate management for the

land, air, or water resources, including but not limited to, plant and animal 
life,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. An environmental harm is imminent if a condition, 
practice or violation exists which:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) is causing such harm or,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) may reasonably be expected to cause such harm at 
any time before the end of the reasonable abatement time that would be set under 
Section 775 of this title,</FONT></P>

organic matter is most abundant and where leaching of soluble or suspended 
particles is the greatest,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. "B horizon". The layer immediately beneath the A 
horizon and often called the subsoil. This middle layer commonly contains more 
clay, iron or aluminum than the A or C horizons, and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. "C horizon". The deepest layer of the soil 
profile. It consists of loose material or weathered rock that is relatively 
unaffected by biologic activity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>45. "Spoil" means displaced overburden.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>46. "Strip mining" means those mining operations 
carried out by removing the overburden lying above natural deposits of coal and 
other minerals, and mining directly from such natural deposits thereby exposed, 
but excludes auger mining, quarrying, dredging, pumping or the use of hydraulic 
methods.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>47. "Substantially disturb" means, for purposes of 
coal exploration, to significantly impact upon land, air or water resources by 
such activities as blasting, mechanical excavation of land, drilling or altering 
coal or water exploratory holes or wells, construction or creation of roads and

debris upon the surface of land.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>48. "Surface coal mining and reclamation operations" 
means surface mining operations and all activities necessary and incident to the 
reclamation of such operations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>49. "Surface coal mining operations" 
means:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. Activities conducted on the surface of lands in 
connection with a surface coal mine or surface operations and surface impacts 
incident to an underground coal mine. Such activities include excavation for the 
purpose of obtaining coal, including such common methods as contour, strip, 
auger, mountaintop removal, box cut, open pit, and area mining, the uses of 
explosives and blasting, in situ distillation or retorting, leaching or other 
chemical or physical processing, and the cleaning, concentrating, or other 
processing or preparation, loading of coal at or near the mine site. Such 
activities do not include the extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of 
other minerals where coal does not exceed sixteen and two-thirds percent (16 
2/3%) of the tonnage of minerals removed for the purposes of commercial use or 
sale or coal exploration, subject to Section 745.11 of this title, 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. The areas upon which such activities occur or 
where such activities disturb the natural land surface. Such areas shall also 
include any adjacent land, the use of which is incidental to any such 
activities, all lands affected by the construction of new roads or improvement 
or use of existing roads to gain access to the site of such activities and for 
haulage and excavations, workings, impoundments, dams, ventilation shafts, 
entryways, refuse banks, dumps, stockpiles, overburden piles, spoil banks, culm 
banks, tailings, holes or depressions, repair areas, storage areas, processing 
areas, shipping areas and other areas upon which are sited structures, 
facilities, or other property or materials on the surface, resulting from or 
incident to such activities.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>50. "Surface water" means water, either flowing or 
standing, on the surface of the earth.</FONT></P>
