</div>
<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Pursuant to Section 2-10-102 of Title 27A of the 
Oklahoma Statutes, it is the policy of this state to regulate the management of 
solid waste in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. For this 
purpose and for purposes of this section, the collection of solid waste shall be 
a matter of statewide interest.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. For the purpose of this section "political 
subdivision" shall include counties and trusts that provide or contract for 
solid waste collection services.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. No political subdivision shall displace or pass an 
ordinance to displace a private company providing solid waste collection service 
without first:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Holding at least one public hearing seeking 
comment on the advisability of the political subdivision providing such 
service;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Providing at least forty-five (45) days' written 
notice of the hearing, delivered by first-class mail to all private solid waste 
collection companies which provide service in the political subdivision; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Providing public notice of the hearing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Following the final public hearing held pursuant to 
this section, but in no event longer than one (1) year after the date of the 
hearing, if the political subdivision elects to provide such solid waste 
collection services and displace the private solid waste collection company, the 
political subdivision shall purchase by condemnation the private solid waste 
collection services as set forth in this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. A political subdivision shall have the authority 
to acquire by purchase, donation, or condemnation such interests in any private 
company providing solid waste collection services operating within the limits of 
the political subdivision. The political subdivision shall give the owner of the 
displaced private solid waste collection company the opportunity to sell the 
displaced private solid waste collection services to the political subdivision 
at an agreed upon or negotiated price or the political subdivision may acquire 
the business by condemnation as provided in this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. If the political subdivision seeks to condemn the 
displaced private solid waste collection services, the district judge of the 
county in which the displaced services are located, upon petition of either 
party, shall direct the sheriff of the county to summon three disinterested 
freeholders, to be selected by the judge as commissioners, and who shall not 
have a conflict of interest. The commissioners shall be sworn to perform their 
duties impartially and justly. The commissioners shall inspect the company and 
the displaced services and consider the injury which the owner may sustain by 
reason of the condemnation, and they shall assess the just compensation to which 
the owner is entitled. The commissioners shall make a report in writing to the 
clerk of the court, setting forth the quantity, boundaries, and just 
compensation for the property or services taken, and amount of injury done to 
the business, either directly or indirectly, which they assess to the owner. The 
report shall be filed and recorded by the clerk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Immediately upon payment to the clerk of the court 
of the sum assessed by the commissioners, the political subdivision shall be 
authorized to collect solid waste in the area serviced by the owner of the 
business. If the owner refuses to cease collection of solid waste pursuant to 
this section, the court shall issue an order, upon proof, enjoining the owner 
from collecting solid waste in the areas subject to such 
condemnation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. The report of the commissioners may be reviewed by 
the district court, on written exceptions filed by either party in the clerk's 
office within thirty (30) days after the filing of the report. The court, after 
a hearing, shall make such order as right and justice may require, either by 
confirmation, rejection, or by ordering a new appraisal on good cause shown. In 
the event a new appraisement is ordered, the political subdivision shall have 
the continuing right of possession obtained under the first appraisal, unless 
and until its right to condemn has finally been determined otherwise. Either 
party may, within sixty (60) days after the filing of such report, file with the 
clerk a written demand for a trial by jury, in which case the amount of damages 
shall be assessed by a jury, and the trial shall be conducted and judgment 
entered in the same manner as civil actions in the district court. If the party 
demanding the trial does not recover a verdict more favorable to such party than 
the assessment of the commissioners, all costs in the district court shall be 
taxed against such party. If, after the filing of exceptions to the report of 
commissioners as provided in this section, the political subdivision shall fail 
to establish its right to condemn such business, the owner shall be restored to 
possession of the business, or part thereof, and the political subdivision shall 
pay the owner for any damages sustained through the occupation by the political 
subdivision. If such damages cannot be determined by amicable settlement, the 
damages shall be determined by jury trial in the same proceedings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. Either party aggrieved may appeal to the Supreme 
Court from the decision of the district court on exceptions to the report of 
commissioners, or jury trial. The review or appeal shall not delay the work of 
the political subdivision in question if the award of commissioners, or jury, as 
the case may be, has been deposited with the clerk for such owner. In no case 
shall the political subdivision be liable for the costs on the review or appeal 
unless the owner of the business shall be adjudged entitled, upon either review 
or appeal, to a greater amount of damages than was awarded by the commissioners. 
The political subdivision shall in all cases pay the cost of the commissioners' 
fees and expenses, for their services, as determined and ordered paid by the 
judge of the district court in which such case is pending. However, poundage 
fees and condemnation fees shall only be paid by the political subdivision in 
the event of appeal resulting in a jury verdict in excess of the commissioners' 
award. Under no circumstances shall any poundage fees or condemnation fees be 
assessed against the recipient of the award. In case of review or appeal, a 
certified copy of the final order or judgment shall be transmitted by the clerk 
of the court to the county clerk and be filed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. As used in this section:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. "Displace" or "displacement" means a political 
subdivision's provision of a service which prohibits a private company from 
providing the same service and which the company is providing at the time the 
decision to displace is made. Displace or displacement does not mean:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. competition between the political subdivision and 
private companies for individual contracts,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. situations where a political subdivision, at the 
end of a contract with a private company, does not renew the contract and either 
awards the contract to another private company, or, decides to provide for such 
services itself,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. situations where action is taken against the 
private company because the company has acted in a manner threatening to the 
public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the political subdivision 
or resulting in a substantial public nuisance,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. situations where action is taken against the 
private company because the company has materially breached its contract with 
the political subdivision, or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. entering into a contract with a private company to 
provide solid waste collection so long as the contract is not entered into 
pursuant to an ordinance which displaces or authorizes the displacement of 
another private company providing solid waste collection;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. "Just compensation" means the value of the 
business taken, and in addition, any injury to any part of the business not 
taken. Any special and direct benefits to the part of the business not taken may 
be offset only against any injury to the business not taken. If only a part of 
the business is taken, just compensation shall be ascertained by determining the 
difference between the fair market value of the whole business immediately 
before the taking and the fair market value of that portion left remaining 
immediately after the taking; and<BR>3. "Solid waste" shall have the same 
meaning as provided in Section 2-10- 103 of Title 27A of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</FONT></P>
