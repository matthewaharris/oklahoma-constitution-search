<p>1. To make all orders respecting the real property of the county, to sell the public grounds of the county and to purchase other grounds in lieu thereof; and for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section it shall be sufficient to convey all the interests of the county in those grounds when an order made for the sale and a deed is executed in the name of the county by the chair of the board of county commissioners, reciting the order, and signed by the chair and acknowledged by the county clerk for and on behalf of the county;</p>

<p>2. To audit the accounts of all officers having the care, management, collection or disbursement of any money belonging to the county or appropriated for its benefit;</p>

<p>3. To construct and repair bridges and to open, lay out, and vacate highways; provided, however, that when any state institution, school, or department shall own, lease, or otherwise control land on both sides of any established highway, the governing board or body of the same shall have the power to vacate, alter, or relocate the highway adjoining the property in the following manner:</p>

<p>If it should appear that it would be to the best use and interest of the institution, school, or department to vacate, alter, or relocate such highway, the governing board or body shall notify the board of county commissioners, in writing, of their intention to hold a public hearing and determine whether to vacate, alter, or relocate the highway, setting forth the location and terminals of the road, and all data concerning the proposed right-of-way if changed or relocated, and shall give fifteen (15) days notice of the hearing by publication in some newspaper in the county or counties in which the road is located, and the hearing shall be held at the county seat of the county in which the road is located, and if a county line road, may be heard in either county. At the hearing testimony may be taken, and any protests or suggestions shall be received as to the proposed measure, and at the conclusion thereof if the governing board or body shall find that it would be to the best use and interest of the institution, school, or department, and the public generally, they may make an appropriate order either vacating, altering or relocating the highway, which order shall be final if approved by the board of county commissioners. The institution, school, or department may by agreement share the cost of changing any such road. No property owner shall be denied access to a public highway by the order;</p>
