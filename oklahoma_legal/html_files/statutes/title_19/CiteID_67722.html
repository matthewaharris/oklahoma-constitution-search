<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. &nbsp;The board of county commissioners of each county of this state is hereby authorized to provide firefighting service in the county and for such purpose to use county funds to rent, lease or purchase firefighting equipment and to rent or construct and equip and operate fire stations and to employ necessary personnel to provide such service. &nbsp;The board of county commissioners shall also have the authority to determine and collect charges for firefighting services performed by the county from any person to whom such services are provided.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;The board of county commissioners of each county of this state shall have the power to take by grant, purchase, gift, devise or lease, and to dispose of, any real property for the purpose of acquiring right-of-ways and easements necessary in providing firefighting services to the county, including the construction and maintenance of roads and the installation of dry hydrants. &nbsp;The board may use county funds and equipment to construct and maintain such roads and to install such dry hydrants. &nbsp;Provided, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the installation of dry hydrants on privately owned property by the owner thereof at the expense of the owner.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;The board of county commissioners of each county of this state shall have the authority to use county personnel operating county equipment to fight fires in situations where an emergency is determined to exist, provided the firefighting service is requested by the county civil defense director or upon a request of a rural fire department.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;A corporate fire department organized pursuant to the provisions of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=66962">Section 592</a><a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=66962">&nbsp;of Title 18</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes or a county fire department organized pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of this section may petition the board of county commissioners of the county in which the fire department provides protection to convert to a county fire department organized pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. &nbsp;The petition shall set forth and particularly describe the proposed boundaries of such county fire department and shall be accompanied by a map of such proposed fire department, drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch to a mile. &nbsp;The petition shall also set forth the administration, control and ownership of all the corporate fire department's assets in the event such petition is approved. &nbsp;Such petition shall be filed with the county clerk of such county who shall present it to the board of county commissioners at their next regular or special meeting. &nbsp;Upon presentation of such petition, the board of county commissioners shall set the same for hearing at a time not less than twenty (20) days nor more than forty (40) days from the date of presentation and shall direct the county clerk to give notice of such hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proposed county fire department is located. &nbsp;Such notice shall describe the boundaries of the proposed county fire department, shall state the time and place of the hearing, and shall state that any person may appear and protest the organization of the county fire department or the proposed boundaries thereof. &nbsp;The board of county commissioners shall hold the hearing described in said notice, and it shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all protests to the creation of such county fire department and all matters pertaining to the same. &nbsp;It may amend the plan of such proposed county fire department by excluding from within its boundaries any lands which it may deem will not be benefited by the formation of such county fire department, or by including other lands as a part thereof upon application of the owners of such land; provided, however, it shall not exclude from such district any unincorporated lands which are completely surrounded by lands which are included in the proposed county fire department. &nbsp;If the board of county commissioners determines that the conversion of such corporate fire department to a county fire department will be conducive to the public safety of the affected area therein, then said board shall give such proposed county fire department a name and shall authorize and approve the organization of said county fire department.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;To be eligible to convert to a county fire department formed pursuant to this subsection, a fire department shall have a Public Protection Classification of nine (9) or better from ISO Commercial Risk Services, Inc., limit the size of such volunteer county fire department to not less than six or more than twenty members per fire station, and shall be subject to the laws of the State of Oklahoma regarding the administration and operation of a fire department, including, but not limited to, the laws of the State Department of Labor and the State Fire Marshal Commission. &nbsp;For purposes of this subsection, a volunteer fire department is one which has in its employ not more than two full-time salaried firefighters.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;Directors of a county fire department organized pursuant to this subsection shall be residents of said district. &nbsp;At the time of making its order organizing such county fire department, the board of county commissioners shall appoint five directors, one of which shall hold his or her respective office for a term of five (5) years, one of which shall hold his or her respective office for a term of four (4) years, one of which shall hold his or her respective office for a term of three (3) years, one of which shall hold his or her respective office for a term of two (2) years, and one of which shall hold his or her respective office for a term of one (1) year. &nbsp;On or before January 1, 2002, the board of county commissioners shall, for fire departments which operate more than five fire stations, appoint additional directors of a county fire department until the number of directors equals the number of fire stations operated by that county fire department. &nbsp;Each additional director shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners for a term that matches the term of one of the first five directors appointed. &nbsp;Whenever a new fire station is added to a county fire department which has five or more fire stations, the board of county commissioners shall appoint an additional director from that district in which the new fire station has been added. &nbsp;Each year thereafter, there shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners for a term of five (5) years so many members as are necessary to replace all members whose terms are expiring on the board of directors for such county fire department.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;The board of directors of a county fire department organized pursuant to this subsection shall select one of its members to serve as chair and shall appoint a clerk and a treasurer. &nbsp;The board of directors shall fix the term and duties of the chair, clerk and treasurer. &nbsp;The chair and members of the board of directors shall serve without compensation. &nbsp;The treasurer shall give an official bond, in an amount fixed and with sureties approved by the board of county commissioners, conditioned upon the faithful accounting for all money pertaining to the county fire department and coming into his or her hands.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;The board of directors of a county fire department organized pursuant to this subsection shall have the following powers and duties:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;to manage and conduct the business affairs of such county fire department,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;to make and execute all necessary contracts,</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;to purchase or lease-purchase and maintain all necessary and convenient engines, hoses, hose carts or other appliances and supplies for the full equipment of a fire company or department from available funds,</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;to appoint the fire chief, fire company officers and employees (whether paid or volunteer), sufficient to maintain and operate the equipment owned by the county fire department,</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;to take by grant, purchase, gift, devise or lease, and to dispose of real or personal property of every kind necessary for the operation of the county fire department,</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;to construct or otherwise acquire from available funds suitable firehouses and other buildings or structures suitable for the housing of equipment and supplies of the county fire department, or for carrying on its own business and affairs,</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;to employ such officers and employees as may be required from available funds, fix their compensation and prescribe their duties,</p>

<p>h. &nbsp;to establish rules for such county fire department and for the prevention of fires and conflagrations within the department's boundaries and for the protection of property at and during any fire,</p>

<p>i. &nbsp;to do any and all other things necessary and proper in the management and operation of the county fire department for the purpose of protecting property within its boundaries from fire, and</p>

<p>j. &nbsp;to prepare an annual budget and follow existing laws pertaining to the budget process such as public notice, public hearings, protest periods and filing requirements in the same manner as they apply to other forms of government in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;The board of directors of a county fire department organized pursuant to this subsection may submit an application to include the firefighters of such county fire department in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System. &nbsp;The application for participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System shall be submitted in accordance with subsection A of Section <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76592">49-105.2 of Title 11</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. &nbsp;For purposes of complying with&nbsp;<a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76588">Sections 49-103</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76589">49-104</a><a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76589">&nbsp;of Title 11</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, the chair, clerk and treasurer of the board of directors of the county fire department shall serve on the local firefighters pension and retirement board along with three firefighters of such county fire department elected by the members of the county fire department. &nbsp;The chair of the board of directors of the county fire department shall be the chair of the local board of the county fire department and the clerk of the board of directors of the county fire department shall be the secretary of the local board of the county fire department. &nbsp;The chair of the local board of the county fire department shall have a casting vote with the members of the local board of the county fire department only when necessary to avoid a tie vote. &nbsp;The local board of the county fire department shall promulgate such rules as may be necessary to ensure the orderly conduct of a local board meeting. &nbsp;While participating in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System, the board of directors, local board and fire chief of the county fire department shall perform all administrative requirements of the pension system.</p>
