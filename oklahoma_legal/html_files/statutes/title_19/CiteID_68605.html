<p>A. The county purchasing agent:</p>

<p>1. Shall, within the amount of the unencumbered balance, make all purchases that are paid from county funds for the various institutions, departments, officers, and employees of the county, except at public auctions and as otherwise provided for by law;</p>

<p>2. May make purchases for political subdivisions of this state within the county if authorized by appropriate action of the governing board or body of the political subdivision affected;</p>

<p>3. Shall make purchases and rental or lease-purchase agreements only after following the bidding procedures as provided for by law, except:</p>

<p>a. when the purchase does not exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) by department. All purchases made pursuant to this subparagraph shall be by a single purchase order. Splitting purchase orders which would result in paying an amount in excess of the limitations specified in this subparagraph is expressly prohibited. Any person convicted of violating the provisions of this subparagraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and such person shall forfeit the persons position or office,</p>

<p>b. when the total payments of a rental or lease-purchase agreement do not exceed the current bid limit as established in subparagraph a of this paragraph,</p>

<p>c. when articles and items are covered by single-source contracts,</p>

<p>d. service or maintenance contracts on equipment or machinery which are entered into at the time of the purchase of the equipment or machinery,</p>

<p>e. purchases made pursuant to a blanket purchase order as provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=88241">Section 310.8 of Title 62</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes,</p>

<p>h. purchases of tools, apparatus, machinery, or equipment from a state agency or a political subdivision of the state as provided for in subsection C of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67786">Section 421.1</a> of this title,</p>

<p>i. purchases of food for prisoners incarcerated in the county jail; provided, in counties having a population in excess of one hundred thousand (100,000) persons, the county purchasing agent shall follow bidding procedures as provided by law unless the county purchasing agent obtains quotes pursuant to the whole total of food items requisitioned prior to the purchase and the lowest and best quote is selected. Documentation of these quotes shall be recorded in the permanent records of the county clerk,</p>

<p>j. when a county solicits bids for the purchase of processed native materials for road and bridge improvements, the county may accept all bids received, with the lowest and best bid from those accepted to be selected at the time of opening of any construction project. The selection of the bid shall be based upon availability, bid price, and transportation costs,</p>

<p>k. when a vendor has been selected as the lowest and best bidder to furnish a particular item or items to the county during a specified time period and in the event the vendor is unable to perform, the purchasing agent may solicit telephone quotes for the item or items needed or select the next lowest and best bidder from the list of qualified bidders and provide for the purchase of the items at the lowest and best quote available. All vendors submitting bids for the specific product or service will be considered at or below the amount they bid,</p>

<p>l. when considering the purchase of an item or items from the state bid list as provided by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services or the General Services Administration, if the same exact item is available from a local vendor at or below the price listed on the state bid list or the General Services Administration list, the item may be obtained from the vendor,</p>

<p>m. any item or items bid by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services which may be purchased by the county, provided the vendor is willing to supply the item or items to the county at the bid price,</p>

<p>n. when a county obtains proceeds from the sale of its property at a public auction, that county may use those proceeds to acquire items previously identified as needed by the county at the same public auction pursuant to subsection D of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439763">Section 1505</a> of this title,</p>

<p>o. when an item or items have been competitively bid by a county, or on behalf of a group of counties, provided:</p>

<p>(1) the notice to bidders shall list each county which may participate in the purchase of the item or items being bid,</p>

<p>(2) the notice of bid is advertised, as provided by law, in each of the counties which may participate in the purchase of the item or items,</p>

<p>(3) all vendors on the list of qualified bidders of each participating county who offer the item or items for sale received notice of the bid request, and</p>

<p>(4) the vendor awarded the bid is willing and able to provide the item or items at the bid price,</p>

<p>p. counties may participate in a nationwide purchasing program sponsored by the national association representing counties and local cooperative procurement agreements entered into by the counties and other local jurisdictions or any other competitively bid nationwide purchasing program, or</p>

<p>q. when the Governor declares an emergency in a county, the district attorney of that county shall have the authority to temporarily waive competitive bidding procedures for purchases that may expedite a response to the emergency situation. This temporary waiver shall be in addition to any powers exercised pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=99698">Section 683.11 of Title 63</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>

<p>The purchases shall be paid by attaching properly itemized invoices, as described in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439763">Section 1505</a> of this title, to a purchase order which has been prepared by the county purchasing agent and submitting both to the county clerk for filing, encumbering, and consideration for payment by the board of county commissioners;</p>

The term of any lease or lease-purchase agreement authorized pursuant to this paragraph may be for any period up to one (1) year; provided, the term shall not extend beyond the end of any fiscal year, with an option to renew such agreement subject to the requirement that adequate funds are appropriated during the fiscal year by the county for such purpose.
