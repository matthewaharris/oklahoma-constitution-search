<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Joint city-county electrical examining and appeals 
board:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. The board of county commissioners and the 
governing body of any city having a population of one hundred eighty thousand 
(180,000), or more, according to the last preceding Federal Decennial Census or 
any future Federal Census, may, by an agreement in writing, create a joint 
city-county electrical examining and appeals board. The agreement may contain 
such provisions for the creation and manner of dissolution of the board and such 
other matters as may be agreed upon, and shall provide for the appropriations to 
be made by the city and county for the operation of the board. Where used 
herein, the term board shall have reference to the joint city-county electrical 
examining and appeals board unless otherwise specifically noted.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The board shall be composed of seven (7) members. Two 
members shall be required to be holders of certificates of competency as Class A 
electrical contractors. Two members shall be holders of certificates of 
competency as Class A journeyman electricians. The board of county commissioners 
shall appoint one person certified as Class A electrical contractor and one 
person certified as a Class A journeyman electrician. The governing body of the 
city shall appoint one person certified as a Class A electrical contractor and 
one person certified as a Class A journeyman electrician. The remaining three 
members shall be appointed by the governing body of the city with the consent of 
the board of county commissioners, provided however, that if the governing body 
of the city and the board of county commissioners do not concur in such 
appointments within thirty (30) days of any such vacancy the appointments may be 
made by a majority of the members of the board. One member of said board shall 
be a registered professional engineer with experience or training in the field 
of electrical engineering, one member of said board shall be a lawyer admitted 
to practice before the courts of this state, and one member shall be a licensed 
architect. The initial terms of the Class A electrical contractors and the Class 
A journeyman electricians appointed by the governing body of the city and 
appointed by the board of county commissioners shall be for a period of two (2) 
years and the initial term of the remaining three appointments shall be for a 
term of one year. The term of such initial appointees and of all subsequent 
appointees of the city and county shall expire as of July 31 of that calendar 
year in which the terms expire, regardless of the calendar date upon which the 
appointments are made. Subsequent appointments of the city and county shall be 
for terms of two (2) years, except in the case of an appointment to fill a 
vacancy in the membership of the board which latter appointment shall be for the 
unexpired term of the member whose death, resignation, or removal has created 
the vacancy. Following the expiration of the term for which he was appointed, 
any member shall continue to serve until his successor has been appointed and 
qualified; provided, however, that no person shall serve more than two 
successive terms as a member of said board.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A quorum of such board necessary to conduct business 
or take action of a discretionary nature shall be four members.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. It shall be the duty and within the authority of 
said board to perform any or all of the following acts:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) To give written examinations to persons desiring 
to obtain a certificate of competency to engage in or work at that phase or 
classification of the electrical business designated and as the same is herein 
defined as to the applicant's skill and knowledge and entitlement to such 
certificate of competency.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) To re-examine any applicant who fails to pass an 
examination required herein. Provided, however, that such person will be 
ineligible for re-examination until the expiration of ninety (90) days from the 
date of such prior examination. Payment of the examination fees established 
herein must be made for each separate examination or re-examination.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) To hear appeals on technical disputes arising 
between the inspectors of the city, county or metropolitan area and electrical 
contractors, property owners or lessees, as to the interpretation and effect of 
the electrical code as the same is established.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) To prepare and issue interpretative opinions 
relative to the technical aspects of the electrical code, but to perform this 
function only in the event some real dispute has arisen between affected 
parties.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(5) To act as a permanent code committee and to 
investigate and suggest to the proper legislative authority such changes in the 
electrical code as may be desirable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(6) To formulate its own rules and regulations 
pertaining to procedure within the limits set forth in this act, provided all 
examinations required herein upon which a determination or conclusion is reached 
by the board shall be reduced to writing subject to review in accordance with 
provisions hereof and not otherwise in conflict therewith.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(7) To employ necessary clerical personnel subject to 
the joint approval of the city, county or metropolitan area authority, and to 
expend funds for necessary technical and professional services and equipment 
within the limits of appropriations made therefor; all of which shall be subject 
to the terms and conditions of the agreement creating such board.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(8) The board may, upon its own motion or upon a 
charge in writing by any person, consider charges against any licensee or 
certificate of competency holder that such person has been guilty of repeated 
wilful violations of this act or of a transfer of license in violation of this 
act. At all times and in all proceedings the board shall comply with the 
provisions of Chapter 8, Title 75, Oklahoma Statutes, otherwise known as the 
Administrative Procedures Act, and specifically the board shall be required to 
comply with and have the powers and duties of the provisions of Sections 309 et 
seq., Title 75 [75-309], Oklahoma Statutes, in connection with any hearing 
authorized by this act. If the board finds from the evidence presented that the 
charges have been sustained by the evidence presented, it shall then file such 
findings with the district court clerk styled: In Re: The matter of the 
suspension or revocation of the license or certificate of competency of 
"__________", (inserting the name of the person, firm or corporation so 
charged). Such matter shall be docketed and considered as any other civil matter 
within the equity jurisdiction of the district court. The matter shall be 
considered de novo by the district court. The charges and findings of the board 
filed with the district court clerk and any response or answer filed by the 
person, firm or corporation so charged shall constitute the issues for trial by 
the district court. If the district court finds that the evidence sustains the 
charges, the district court may suspend, revoke, or impose sanctions upon the 
license or certificate of competency of any person, firm or corporation found 
guilty of such charges, and provided for the conditions for the reinstatement, 
restoration or removal of sanctions as a part of any such judgment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(9) To issue, reissue or renew licenses, under the 
terms of this act, and to receive and account for all license and examination 
fees paid to it. Funds so received shall be deposited as provided in the 
agreement establishing the board.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(10) Proceedings of the board shall be in writing 
with minutes kept of all meetings, both regular and special. Copies of 
proceedings, including findings, determinations and interpretations shall be 
public records, and all meetings, both regular and special, shall be open to the 
public, except during those meetings when the examination of applicants for 
certificates of competency are being conducted or personnel matters are being 
considered.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. Any ruling, requirement, decision or 
interpretation of the board shall be final and binding upon all parties thereto 
unless appealed to the district court of competent jurisdiction within fifteen 
(15) days from the rendition of such rule, requirement, decision or 
interpretation, in the manner and form now provided by statute for appeals 
generally. In the event of an appeal, any party aggrieved by the action of the 
board shall serve a copy of the petition of appeal upon the secretary or any 
member of the board within fifteen (15) days following the action from which an 
appeal is taken.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Any appeal from a judgment, decision, action or 
determination of the board considered by the board under the provisions of 
Section 3, subsection b., (3), of this act in regard to technical disputes shall 
be to the district court sitting as an appellate tribunal. All other appeals 
shall be to the district court for hearing and trial de novo.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Any contractor, property owner or lessee who appeals 
the decision of the board relating to electrical code requirements to the 
district court must, upon order of the district court, file with the clerk of 
the district court a bond in an amount as determined by the district court to be 
sufficient to place the work in condition to satisfy the requirements of the 
code. Upon failure to file a bond as herein required, the appeal shall be 
dismissed. Anyone taking an appeal from the board must pursue the appeal 
diligently and in the event the appeal is not heard within six (6) months, due 
to failure of the appellant to diligently pursue the appeal, the court shall 
thereupon dismiss said appeal with prejudice and order the action appealed from 
enforced.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. The filing of a notice of appeal from a decision 
of the electrical inspector or the board shall stay any order of the electrical 
inspector or board if such order is based upon a technical violation of the 
electrical code. If the board or a court of competent jurisdiction shall 
determine that such order is based on a present and immediate danger to life and 
property, then any appeal as permitted herein shall not stay the order of the 
electrical inspector, provided, however, that any such order shall be made in 
writing and served on the affected parties.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. The expenses of operating the board shall be 
provided for under the terms of the agreement creating such board. Necessary 
funds will be appropriated by the city or county, or both, as the case may be, 
for the purpose of defraying approved operating expenses. The manner in which 
claims shall be presented and approved for payment shall be provided by the 
agreement creating the board. Members of the board shall be compensated for 
attendance at meetings in an amount fixed by the agreement creating the board 
not to exceed Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per diem, and such compensation shall be 
limited to two meetings per calendar month.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. All actions, decisions and opinions of the board 
which have become final shall be binding upon the electrical inspectors and upon 
all of the parties to the proceeding in which the action, decision or opinion 
has been given, shall remain in force and be binding thereafter until otherwise 
changed, overruled, modified or cancelled.</FONT></P><B><I>
