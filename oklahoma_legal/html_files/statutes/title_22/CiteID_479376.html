Black and white photocopies of color exhibits are not acceptable.&nbsp;If the exhibit is an audio or video tape or other electronically reproduced medium, the reporter shall be responsible for ensuring that the original and two (2) copies of the item are filed with the transcripts. In each instance, as a condition to the admissibility of the exhibit for consideration on appeal, the trial court shall ensure the party introducing the exhibit shall be responsible for both its reproduction in the same quality as the original, including delivery to the court reporter, and the cost of reproduction. If a party fails to comply with a reporter's request to provide copies of exhibits in accordance with this Rule, the court reporter, after completion of the transcripts, shall file a notice of non-completion with the clerk of the District Court and the Clerk of this Court setting out with specificity the items that have not been provided, when the request was made and the party who has failed to comply with this Rule..</FONT> </P>
