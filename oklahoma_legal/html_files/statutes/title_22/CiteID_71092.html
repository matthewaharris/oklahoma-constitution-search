<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>
<P>A. At any time after the institution of any civil proceeding or at any time 
after the filing of an indictment or information pursuant to the provisions of 
the Oklahoma Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the state may 
file a lien notice in the official records as may be required for perfecting a 
security interest for any given property. A filing fee in the amount as required 
by law for the filing of a mechanic's or materialmen's lien shall be required as 
a condition for filing the lien notice, and the county clerk, upon the 
presentation of such lien notice, shall immediately record it in the official 
records.</P>
<P>B. The lien notice shall be signed by the Attorney General or by a district 
attorney. The notice shall be in such form as the Attorney General prescribes 
and shall set forth the following information:</P>
<P>1. The name of the person against whom the proceeding has been brought or who 
has been charged or indicted for a violation of this act and any other names 
under which the person may be known. The Attorney General or district attorney 
may also name in the lien notice any enterprise that is either controlled by or 
entirely owned by the person;</P>
<P>2. If known to the Attorney General or district attorney, the present 
residence and business addresses of the persons named in the lien notice;</P>
<P>3. A reference to the criminal or civil proceeding stating that a proceeding 
pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act has been brought against the person named in the lien notice 
or that the person has been charged or indicted for a violation of this act, the 
name of the county or counties where the proceeding has been brought or the 
conviction was made and any other lien notices filed, and, if known to the 
Attorney General or district attorney at the time of filing the lien notice, the 
case number of the proceeding;</P>
<P>4. A statement that the notice is being filed pursuant to the provisions of 
the Oklahoma Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; and</P>
<P>5. The name and address of the Attorney General or the district attorney 
filing the lien notice.</P>
<P>A lien notice shall apply only to one person and, to the extent applicable, 
the names of enterprises, to the extent permitted in this section. A separate 
lien notice shall be filed for any other person against whom the Attorney 
General or district attorney desires to file a lien notice pursuant to the 
provisions of this section.</P>
<P>C. Within ten (10) days after filing of each lien notice, the Attorney 
General or district attorney shall furnish to the person named in the notice by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last-known business or 
residential address, a copy of the recorded notice. In the event the person 
cannot be served by certified mail, service may be by publication pursuant to <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=94862">Section 2004</A> of Title 12 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes.</P>
<P>D. From the time of its filing, a lien notice creates a lien in favor of the 
state on the following property of the person named in the notice:</P>
<P>1. Any personal or real property owned by the person under any name set forth 
in the lien notice which is situated in the county where the notice is filed; 
and</P>
<P>2. Any beneficial interest of said property owned by the person under any 
name located in the county where the notice is filed.</P>
<P>The lien shall commence and attach as of the time of filing of the lien 
notice and shall continue thereafter until expiration, termination, or release 
of the lien. The lien created in favor of the state shall be superior and prior 
to the interest of any other person in the personal or real property or 
beneficial interest in said property, if the interest is acquired subsequent to 
the filing of the notice.</P>
<P>E. In conjunction with any civil proceeding:</P>
<P>1. The Attorney General or district attorney may file without prior court 
order in any county a lis pendens pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma 
Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. In that event, any person 
acquiring an interest in the subject real property or beneficial interest in it 
after the filing of the lis pendens, shall take the interest subject to the 
civil proceeding and any subsequent judgment of forfeiture; and</P>
<P>2. If a lien notice has been filed, the Attorney General or district attorney 
may name as defendants, in addition to the person named in the notice, any 
person acquiring an interest in the personal or real property or beneficial 
interest in it subsequent to the filing of the notice. If a judgment of 
forfeiture is entered in the proceeding in favor of the state, the interest of 
any person in the property that was acquired subsequent to the filing of the 
notice and judgment of forfeiture shall be subject to the notice and judgment of 
forfeiture.</P>
<P>F. Upon the entry of a final judgment of forfeiture in favor of the state, 
the title to the forfeited real property shall be transferred to the state and 
shall be recorded in the official records of the county where the real property 
or a beneficial interest in it is located.</P>
<P>In the case of personal property or a beneficial interest in it, the property 
shall be seized if not already in possession of the state and disposed of in 
accordance with the Oklahoma Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
Act.</P>
<P>G. If personal or real property or a beneficial interest in it subject to 
forfeiture is conveyed, alienated, disposed of, or otherwise rendered 
unavailable for forfeiture after the filing of a lien notice, the state may 
treat it as a fraudulent and preferential conveyance and may institute an action 
in any district court against the person named in the lien notice, the defendant 
in the civil proceeding or the person convicted in the criminal proceeding; and 
the court shall enter final judgment against such person or any beneficial 
interest in it together with investigative costs and attorneys fees incurred by 
the state in the action. If a civil proceeding is pending, such action shall be 
filed only in the court where such civil proceeding is pending.</P>
<P>H. The filing of a lien notice shall not affect the use to which personal or 
real property or a beneficial interest in it owned by the person named in the 
racketeering lien may be entitled to or the right of the person to receive any 
avails, rents, or other proceeds resulting from the use and ownership of the 
property, except for the conveyance of said property, until a judgment of 
forfeiture is entered.</P>
<P>I. The term of a lien notice shall be for a period of six (6) years from the 
date of filing unless a renewal lien notice has been filed by the Attorney 
General or district attorney. In this event, the term of the renewal lien notice 
shall be for a period of six (6) years from the date of its filing. The Attorney 
General or district attorney shall be entitled to only one renewal of the lien 
notice.</P>
<P>J. The Attorney General or district attorney filing the lien notice may 
release in whole or in part any lien notice or may release any personal or real 
property or beneficial interest in it from the lien notice upon such terms and 
conditions as the Attorney General or district attorney may determine. Any 
release of a lien notice executed by the Attorney General or district attorney 
may be filed in the official records of any county. No charge or fee shall be 
imposed for the filing of any release of a lien notice.</P>
<P>K. If no civil proceeding has been instituted by the Attorney General or 
district attorney seeking a forfeiture of any property owned by the person named 
in the lien notice, the acquittal in the criminal proceeding of the person named 
in the lien notice or the dismissal of the criminal proceeding, shall terminate 
the lien notice. If the civil proceeding has been instituted, in the event the 
criminal proceeding has been dismissed or the person named in the lien notice 
has been acquitted in the criminal proceeding, the lien notice shall continue 
for the duration of the civil proceeding.</P>
<P>L. If no civil proceeding or criminal proceeding is then pending against the 
person named in the lien notice, any person named in a lien notice may apply to 
the district court in the county where the notice has been filed for the release 
or extinguishment of the notice and the district court shall enter a judgment 
extinguishing the lien notice or releasing the personal or real property or 
beneficial interest in it from the lien notice.</P>
<P>M. In the event a civil proceeding is pending against a person named in a 
lien notice, the district court upon motion by the person may grant the relief 
provided for in this section at a hearing held for that purpose:</P>
<P>1. If a sale of the personal or real property or beneficial interest in it is 
pending and the filing of the notice prevents the sale of the property or 
interest, the district court shall immediately enter its order releasing from 
the lien notice any specific personal or real property or beneficial interest in 
it. The proceeds resulting from the sale of the personal or real property or 
beneficial interest in it shall be deposited with the clerk of the district 
court, subject to the further order of the district court; and</P>
<P>2. At the hearing, the district court may release from the lien notice any 
personal or real property or beneficial interest in it upon the posting by such 
person of such security as is equal to the value of the personal or real 
property or beneficial interest in it owned by such person.</P>
