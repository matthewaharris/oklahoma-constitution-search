<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Interstate Agreement on Detainers is hereby 
enacted into law and entered into by this state with all jurisdictions legally 
joining in substantially the following form:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>"The contracting states solemnly agree 
that:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article I</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The party states find that charges outstanding 
against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or 
complaints and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already 
incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct 
programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy 
of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the 
expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the 
proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, 
informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with 
reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another 
jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. 
It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative 
procedures.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article II</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As used in this agreement:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) "State" shall mean a state of the United States; 
the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; 
the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) "Sending state" shall mean a state in which a 
prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final 
disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for 
custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) "Receiving state" shall mean the state in which 
trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to 
Article III or Article IV hereof.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article III</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of 
imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and 
whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in 
any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the 
basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be 
brought to trial within one hundred eighty (180) days after he shall have caused 
to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the 
prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his 
imprisonment and his request for final disposition to be made of the indictment, 
information or complaint; provided, that, for good cause shown in open court, 
the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the 
matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the 
prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official 
having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the 
prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served 
on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility 
of the prisoner and any decision of the state parole agency relating to the 
prisoner.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The written notice and request for final 
disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the 
prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or any other official having 
custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to 
the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, 
return receipt requested.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or other 
official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source 
and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his 
right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or 
complaint on which the detainer is based.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) Any request for final disposition made by a 
prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final 
disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis 
of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose 
prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. 
The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the 
prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts 
in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request 
for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the 
prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied 
by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request and the certificate. If 
trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby 
prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such 
indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or 
effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with 
prejudice.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) Any request for final disposition made by a 
prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of 
extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or 
included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition 
to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after 
completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for 
final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the 
production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order 
to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily 
to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the 
provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the 
imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to 
his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) 
hereof shall void the request.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article IV</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in 
which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be 
entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is 
serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance 
with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary 
custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the 
prisoner is incarcerated; provided, that the court having jurisdiction of such 
indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and 
transmitted the request; and provided further, that there shall be a period of 
thirty (30) days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request 
be honored, within which period the Governor of the sending state may disapprove 
the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or 
upon motion of the prisoner.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) Upon request of the officer's written request as 
provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the 
prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the 
term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already 
served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time 
earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner and any decisions of the 
state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously 
shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state 
who has lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with 
notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the 
reasons therefor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by 
this article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days of 
the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in 
open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having 
jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable 
continuance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) Nothing contained in this article shall be 
construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the 
legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery 
may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the 
sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such 
delivery.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, 
information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being 
returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e) hereof, 
such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or 
effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with 
prejudice.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article V</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) In response to a request made under Article III 
or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer 
to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in 
the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against 
such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the 
request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary 
custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this 
agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the 
receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this 
agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place of 
trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the 
custodian.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) The officer or other representative of a state 
accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon 
demand:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) Proper identification and evidence of his 
authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody this prisoner is to 
be given.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, 
information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and 
on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been 
made.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail 
to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on 
the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has 
been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or 
Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the 
indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order 
dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease 
to be of any force or effect.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(d) The temporary custody referred to in this 
agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge 
or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or 
complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution 
on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for 
his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at 
which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable 
jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting 
prosecution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with 
the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending 
state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or 
while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by 
this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good 
time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law 
and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may 
allow.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(g) For all purposes other than that for which 
temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall 
be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the 
sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the 
same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other 
manner permitted by law.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(h) From the time that a party state receives custody 
of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the 
territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more 
untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is 
being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of 
transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of 
this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into 
a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and 
responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall 
be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, 
agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a 
party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or 
responsibilities therefor.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article VI</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(a) In determining the duration and expiration dates 
of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the 
running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the 
prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having 
jurisdiction of the matter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy 
made available by this agreement shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be 
mentally ill.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article VII</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Each state party to this agreement shall designate an 
officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall 
promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and 
provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the 
state, information necessary to the effective operation of this 
agreement.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article VIII</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This agreement shall enter into full force and effect 
as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law. A state party 
to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the 
same. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any 
proceedings already initiated by inmates or by the state officers at the time 
such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect 
thereof.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>Article IX</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to 
effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and 
if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be 
contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the 
applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held 
invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability 
thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected 
thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any 
state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to 
the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to 
all severable matters."</FONT></P><B><I>
