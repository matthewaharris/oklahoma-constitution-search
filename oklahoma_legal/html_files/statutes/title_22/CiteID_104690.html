<P>The Governor is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf 
of this State with any other state or states legally joining therein in the 
form, substantially as follows:</P>
<P align=center>INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR ADULT OFFENDER SUPERVISION</P>
<P align=center><BR>ARTICLE I. <BR>FINDINGS AND PURPOSES</P>
<P>A. The Compacting States to this Interstate Compact recognize:</P>
<P>1. That each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in 
the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this 
compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in 
such manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision 
authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return 
offenders to the originating jurisdictions; and</P>
<P>2. That Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C., Section 112 
(1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and 
mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</P>
<P>B. The purposes of this compact and the Interstate Commission created 
hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the Compacting 
States, are to:</P>
<P>1. Provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the 
rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement 
of offenders in the community;</P>
<P>2. Provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of 
these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and</P>
<P>3. Equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact 
among the Compacting States.</P>
<P>C. This compact will:</P>
<P>1. Create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to 
manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision 
and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling 
authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will 
promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact;</P>
<P>2. Ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to 
jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate 
across state lines;</P>
<P>3. Establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on 
active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of 
compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and 
legislative branches and criminal justice administrators;</P>
<P>4. Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders 
and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and</P>
<P>5. Coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate 
movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.</P>
<P>D. The compacting states recognize that there is no "right" of any offender 
to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state 
may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any 
offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and Bylaws 
and Rules promulgated hereunder.</P>
<P>E. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by 
the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies 
and are therefore public business.</P>

and</P>
<P>9. Establishing standards and procedures for compliance and technical

<P>B. 1. The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the Members, elect 
from among its Members a chairperson and a vice-chairperson, each of whom shall 
have such authorities and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The 
chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice-chairperson 
shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission. The Officers so 
selected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the Interstate 
Commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the 
officers shall be reimbursed for any actual and necessary costs and expenses 
incurred by them in the performance of their duties and responsibilities as 
officers of the Interstate Commission.</P>
<P>2. The Interstate Commission shall, through its executive committee, appoint 
or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions 
and for such compensation as the Interstate Commission may deem appropriate. The

or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any 
actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of 
Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that 
nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from 
suit and/or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the 
intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.</P>
<P>2. The Interstate Commission shall defend the commissioner of a compacting 
state, or the commissioner's representatives or employees, or the Interstate 
Commission's representatives or employees in any civil action seeking to impose 
liability, arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that 
occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or 
responsibilities or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing 
occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or 
responsibilities. Provided, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission 
did not result from intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.</P>
<P>3. The Interstate Commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a 
Compacting State, the appointed designees or employees, or the Interstate 
Commission's representatives or employees, harmless in the amount of any 
settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual 
or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate 
Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had 
reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate 
Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that the actual or 
alleged act, error, or omission did not result from gross negligence or 
intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE VII.<BR>ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</P>
<P>A. The Interstate Commission shall meet and take such actions as are 
consistent with the provisions of this Compact.</P>
<P>B. Except as otherwise provided in this compact and unless a greater 
percentage is required by the bylaws, in order to constitute an act of the 
Interstate Commission, each act shall have been taken at a meeting of the 
Interstate Commission and shall have received an affirmative vote of a majority 
of the members present.</P>
<P>C. Each member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to 
cast a vote to which that Compacting State is entitled and to participate in the 
business and affairs of the Interstate Commission. A Member shall vote in person 
on behalf of the state and shall not delegate a vote to another member state. 
However, a State Council shall appoint another authorized representative, in the 
absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the 
member state at a specified meeting. The bylaws may provide for Members' 
participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or 
electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone or other means of 
telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same 
quorum requirements of meetings where members are present in person.</P>
<P>D. The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar 
year. The chair of the Interstate Commission may call additional meetings at any 
time and, upon the request of a majority of the members, shall call additional 
meetings.</P>
<P>E. The Interstate Commission's bylaws shall establish conditions and 
procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and 
official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The 
Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official 
records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or 
proprietary interests. In promulgating such rules, the Interstate Commission may 
make available to law enforcement agencies records and information otherwise 
exempt from disclosure and may enter into agreements with law enforcement 
agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure 
and confidentiality provisions.</P>
<P>F. Public notice shall be given of all meetings, and all meetings shall be 
open to the public except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in 
the Compact. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate rules consistent with 
the principles contained in the Government in Sunshine Act, Section 552(b), of 
Title 5 of the United States Code. The Interstate Commission and any of its 
committees may close a meeting to the public where it determines by a two-thirds 
vote that an open meeting would be likely to:</P>
<P>1. Relate solely to the Interstate Commission's internal personnel practices

COMMISSION</P>
<P>A. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate rules in order to effectively 
and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact including transition rules 
governing administration of the compact during the period in which it is being 
considered and enacted by the states.</P>
<P>B. Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Article 
and the Bylaws and Rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall 
substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure 
Act, Section 551, et seq. of Title 5 of the United States Code, and the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act, App. 2, Section 1, et seq. of Title 5 of the United 
State Code, as may be amended (APA). All Rules and amendments shall become 
binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.</P>
<P>C. If a majority of the legislatures of the Compacting States rejects a Rule 
by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the 
compact, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compacting 
State.</P>
<P>D. When promulgating a rule, the Interstate Commission shall:</P>
<P>1. Publish the proposed rule stating with particularity the text of the rule 
which is proposed and the reason for the proposed rule;</P>
<P>2. Allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments which 
information shall be publicly available;</P>
<P>3. Provide an opportunity for an informal hearing; and</P>
<P>4. Promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on 
the rulemaking record.</P>
<P>E. Not later than sixty (60) days after a Rule is promulgated, any interested 
person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission's 
principal office is located for judicial review of such Rule.<B> </B>If the 
court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by 
substantial evidence (as defined in the APA) in the rulemaking record, the court 
shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside.</P>
<P>F. Subjects to be addressed in rules within twelve (12) months after the 
first meeting must at a minimum include:</P>
<P>1. Notice to victims and opportunity to be heard;</P>
<P>2. Offender registration and compliance;</P>
<P>3. Violations/returns;</P>
<P>4. Transfer procedures and forms;</P>
<P>5. Eligibility for transfer;</P>
<P>6. Collection of restitution and fees from offenders;</P>
<P>7. Data collection and reporting;</P>
<P>8. Level of supervision to be provided by the receiving state;</P>
<P>9. Transition rules governing the operation of the compact and the Interstate 
Commission during all or part of the period between the effective date of the 
compact and the date on which the last eligible state adopts the compact;</P>
<P>10. Mediation, arbitration, and dispute resolution.</P>
<P>G. The existing rules governing the operation of the previous compact 
superceded by this act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first 
meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.</P>
<P>H. Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that an emergency exists, 
it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately 
upon adoption; provided, that the usual rulemaking procedures shall be 
retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event 
later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE IX.<BR>OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND<BR>DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
BY THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</P>
<P>A. 1. The Interstate Commission shall oversee the interstate movement of 
adult offenders in the Compacting States and shall monitor such activities being 
administered in Non-Compacting States which may significantly affect Compacting 
States.</P>
<P>2. The courts and executive agencies in each Compacting State shall enforce 
this Compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate 
the Compact's purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding 
in a Compacting State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may 
affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the 
Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any 
such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all 
purposes.</P>
<P>B. 1. The Compacting States shall report to the Interstate Commission on 
issues or activities of concern to them and cooperate with and support the 
Interstate Commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.</P>
<P>2. The Interstate Commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other 
issues which are subject to the Compact and which may arise among Compacting 
States and Non-Compacting States.</P>
<P>3. The Interstate Commission shall enact a Bylaw or promulgate a Rule 
providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among 
Compacting States.</P>
<P>C. The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, 
shall enforce the provisions of this Compact using any or all means set forth in 
Article XII, Section B, of this Compact.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE X. <BR>FINANCE</P>
<P>A. The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the 
reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing 
activities.</P>
<P>B. The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment 
from each Compacting State to cover the cost of the internal operations and 
activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total 
amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved 
each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon 
a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into 
consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement 
of offenders in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon 
all Compacting States which governs said assessment.</P>
<P>C. The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind 
prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same. Nor shall the Interstate 
Commission pledge the credit of any of the Compacting States except by and with 
the authority of the compacting state.</P>
<P>D. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and 
disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall 
be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. 
However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate 
Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant 
and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual 
report of the Interstate Commission.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE XI.<BR>COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE, AND 
AMENDMENT</P>
<P>A. Any state, as defined in Article II of this Compact, is eligible to become 
a Compacting State. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon 
legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no fewer than thirty-five of 
the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2001, or 
upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter, it shall 
become effective and binding as to any other Compacting State upon enactment of 
the Compact into law by that State. The governors of Nonmember states or their 
designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on 
a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories 
of the United States.</P>
<P>B. Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for 
enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and 
binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and 
until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE XII.<BR>WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND JUDICIAL 
ENFORCEMENT</P>
<P>A. 1. Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding 
upon each Compacting State; provided that a Compacting State may withdraw from 
the compact ("Withdrawing State") by enacting a statute specifically repealing 
the statute which enacted the Compact into law. The effective date of withdrawal 
is the effective date of the repeal.</P>
<P>2. The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Chairperson of the 
Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing 
this Compact in the Withdrawing State. The Interstate Commission shall notify 
the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent<B> </B>to withdraw 
within sixty (60) days of its receipt of the notice.</P>
<P>3. The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and 
liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any 
obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of 
withdrawal.</P>
<P>4. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur 
upon the reenactment of the Compact by the Withdrawing State or upon such later 
date as determined by the Interstate Commission.</P>
<P>B. If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at 
any time defaulted ("Defaulting State") in the performance of any of its 
obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or any duly 
promulgated Rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the 
following penalties:</P>
<P>a. fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as 
fixed by the Interstate Commission,</P>
<P>b. remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate 
Commission,</P>
<P>c. suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall 
be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under 
the Bylaws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall 
be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or 
Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the 
defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council.</P>
<P>C. 1. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a 
Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it 
by this Compact, Interstate Commission Bylaws, or duly promulgated Rules. The 
Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing 
of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State 
pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the 
conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its 
default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time 
period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other 
penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the 
Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compacting States and all 
rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated 
from the effective date of suspension.</P>
<P>2. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a 
Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief 
Justice or Chief Judicial Officer, and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the 
Defaulting State's Legislature and the State Council of such termination.</P>
<P>3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and 
liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any 
obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of 
termination.</P>
<P>4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the 
Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate 
Commission and the Defaulting State. Reinstatement following termination of any 
compacting state requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting 
State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.</P>
<P>D. The Interstate Commission may, by a majority vote of the Members, initiate 
legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia 
or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District 
where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the 
provisions of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and Bylaws against any 
Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the 
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including 
reasonable attorney fees.</P>
<P>E. The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default 
of a Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting 
State. Upon dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and 
shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the 
Interstate Commission shall be wound up, and any surplus funds shall be 
distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE XIII.<BR>SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION</P>
<P>A. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, 
sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the 
Compact shall be enforceable.</P>
<P>B. The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate 
its purposes.</P>
<P align=center>ARTICLE XIV.<BR>BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS</P>
<P>A. Nothing in this Compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a 
Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact. All Compacting 
States' laws conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the 
conflict.</P>
<P>B. 1. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules 
and Bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the 
Compacting States.</P>
<P>2. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States 
are binding in accordance with their terms.</P>
<P>3. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation 
of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting 
States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such 
meaning or interpretation.</P>
<P>4. In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional 
limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, 
duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon 
the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective. Such obligations, duties, 
powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be 
exercised by the agency in the state to which such obligations, duties, powers, 
or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes 
effective.</P><B><I>
