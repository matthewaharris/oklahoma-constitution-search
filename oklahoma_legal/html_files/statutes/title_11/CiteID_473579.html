<FONT SIZE=1>Cite as:  O.S. §, __  __</FONT><HR>

</div>
<FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. An abandoned building shall constitute a public nuisance because it:</P>
<P>1. Is detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare of the inhabitants 
of and visitors to the municipality;</P>
<P>2. Causes increased municipal regulatory costs and increased municipal police 
and fire protection costs; and</P>
<P>3. Devalues abutting and nearby real properties.</P>
<P>B. A municipal governing body may abate the public nuisance caused by an 
abandoned building within the municipal limits in accordance with the following 
procedures:</P>
<P>1. At least ten (10) days' notice that an abandoned building is to be abated 
pursuant to the procedures for abatement set forth in this section shall be 
given to the owner of the property before the governing body holds a hearing. A 
copy of the notice shall be sent by mail to the property owner at the address 
shown by the current year's tax rolls in the office of the county treasurer. 
Written notice shall also be sent by mail to any mortgage holder as shown by the 
records in the office of the county clerk to the last-known address of the 
mortgage holder. At the time of mailing of notice to any property owner or 
mortgage holder, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the 
postal service, the receipt of which shall indicate the date of mailing and the 
name and address of the mailee. However, if neither the property owner nor 
mortgage holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the 
notice on the property and by publication as defined in Section 1-102 of Title 
11 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Such notice shall be published once not less than 
ten (10) days prior to any hearing or action by the municipality pursuant to the 
provisions of this section;</P>
<P>2. A hearing shall be held by the governing body to determine if the property 
is an abandoned building as defined by this section;</P>
<P>3. Pursuant to a determination that the building is an abandoned building, 
the governing body may order the agents of the municipality to pursue abatement 
of the public nuisance caused by the building and shall order the municipal 
clerk to place the building on an abandoned building list to be maintained by 
the clerk. At any time after such determination and order, the agents of the 
municipality may cause the public nuisance to be abated as authorized in this 
section, and such abatement may continue until such time as the building is 
removed from the abandoned building list in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in subsection C of this section;</P>
<P>4. Abatement of an abandoned building by the municipality may include any or 
all of the following:</P>
<P>a. any lawful municipal regulatory or municipal police and fire protection 
action in relation to the abandoned building or the owner of such building 
necessary or appropriate for the protection of inhabitants in and visitors to 
the municipality. Upon receipt of any necessary warrant to authorize such 
action, the agents of the municipality are granted the right of entry onto the 
property for the performance of any such action as a governmental function of 
the municipality,</P>
<P>b. the quarterly assessment against the property on which the abandoned 
building is located and against the owner of the abandoned building of the 
actual costs of any municipal regulatory action taken in relation to the 
abandoned building or the owner of such building as authorized above,</P>
<P>c. the assessment against the property on which the abandoned building is 
located and against the owner of the abandoned building of the actual costs of 
any municipal police or fire protection action taken in relation to the 
abandoned building or the owner of such building as authorized above, and</P>
<P>d. an assessment for any other actual expenses incurred by the municipality 
in relation to the abandoned building, including, but not limited to, the costs 
of notices, mailings and publications;</P>
<P>5. After the determination that a building is an abandoned building, and 
before commencement of any of the abatement actions authorized by paragraphs 3 
and 4 of this subsection, the municipal clerk shall file a notice of lien with 
the county clerk describing the property, the findings of the governing body at 
the hearing, and stating that the municipality claims a lien on the property for 
all abatement costs and that such costs shall also constitute the personal 
obligation of the property owner from and after the date of filing of the 
notice;</P>
<P>6. From and after the determination that a building is an abandoned building, 
and continuing until such time as the building is removed from the abandoned 
building list in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection C of 
this section, the municipal clerk shall determine the actual quarterly abatement 
costs for the abatement procedures authorized by this section. After such 
determination, the municipal clerk shall mail a statement of the actual 
quarterly abatement costs for the abatement procedures authorized by this 
section to the property owner and demand the payment of such costs by the owner. 
In addition, a copy of the statement shall be mailed to any mortgage holder at 
the address provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection. At the time of 
mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner or mortgage holder, the 
municipal clerk shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, the 
receipt of which shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of 
the mailee; and</P>
<P>7. When full payment is made to the municipal clerk for actual abatement 
costs incurred and billed in accordance with paragraph 6 of this subsection, the 
municipal clerk shall send the property owner and any mortgage holder by mail a 
receipt for such payment; but if payment attributable to the actual quarterly 
costs of such abatement is not made within six (6) months from the date of the 
mailing of the statement to the owner of such property, a lien in the actual 
amount of the abatement shall be filed against the abandoned building. Until 
finally paid, the costs and the interest thereon shall be the personal 
obligation of the property owner from and after the date the notice of lien was 
filed with the county clerk. In addition, the costs and the interest thereon 
shall be a lien against the property from the date the notice of lien was filed 
with the county clerk. The lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem 
taxes and all other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and 
superior to all other titles and liens against the property. The lien shall 
continue until the cost is fully paid. A mineral interest, if severed from the 
surface interest and not owned by the surface owner, shall not be subject to any 
lien created pursuant to this section. Upon receiving full payment, the 
municipal clerk shall forward to the county clerk a notice of discharge of the 
lien.</P>
<P>C. Any owner or mortgage holder of any building determined by the governing 
body of the municipality to be an abandoned building pursuant to this section 
may petition the governing body in writing at any time after such determination 
for removal of such building from the abandoned building list maintained by the 
municipal clerk. Any such petition shall be filed with the municipal clerk. 
Within thirty (30) days after such petition is filed with the municipal clerk, 
the governing body shall hold a hearing to determine if the building is no 
longer an abandoned building. Upon such a determination, the governing body 
shall order the building removed from the abandoned building list. The municipal 
clerk shall comply with such order by removing the building from the abandoned 
building list; provided, the real property on which the abandoned building is 
located and the owner of such building shall remain liable for payment of any 
and all abatement costs incurred by the municipality prior to the determination 
and order by the governing body that the building should be removed from the 
abandoned building list. Upon full payment of any costs certified against the 
property, the municipal clerk shall file a release of the notice of the lien in 
the county clerk's office within ten (10) days after receiving such payment.</P>
<P>D. The governing body may designate, by ordinance, an administrative officer 
or administrative body of the municipality to carry out any or all of the duties 
of the governing body specified in this section. The property owner shall have 
the right of appeal to the governing body from any order of the administrative 
officer or administrative body. Such appeal shall be taken by filing a written 
notice of appeal with the municipal clerk within ten (10) days after the 
administrative order is delivered or mailed to the owner at the address shown in 
the county treasurer records.</P>
<P>E. For purposes of this section:</P>
<P>1. "Abandoned building" means any building located within the municipality 
that is not currently occupied and has been declared unsecured or dilapidated 
pursuant to Section 22-112 or 22-112.1 of Title 11 of the Oklahoma Statutes and 
remains in such condition; and</P>
<P>2. "Owner" means the owner of record as shown by the most current tax roles 
of the county treasurer.</P>
<P>F. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property zoned and 
used for agricultural purposes.</P>
<P>G. The officers, employees or agents of the municipality shall not be liable 
for any damages or loss of property due to the abatement of the public nuisance 
caused by an abandoned building performed pursuant to the provisions of this 
section or as otherwise provided by law.</P>
