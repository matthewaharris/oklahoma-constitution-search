A member shall include eligible commissioned officers of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and the Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission who elect to participate in the System pursuant to </font><a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=104725">Section 50-111.5</a><font color="#000000"> of this title;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">7. Normal retirement date means the date at which the member is eligible to receive the unreduced payments of the members accrued retirement benefit. Such date shall be the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date the member completes twenty (20) years of credited service. If the members employment continues past the normal retirement date of the member, the actual retirement date of the member shall be the first day of the month after the member terminates employment with more than twenty (20) years of credited service;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">8. Credited service means the period of service used to determine the eligibility for and the amount of benefits payable to a member. Credited service shall consist of the period during which the member participated in the System or the predecessor municipal systems as an active employee in an eligible membership classification, plus any service prior to the establishment of the predecessor municipal systems which was credited under the predecessor municipal systems or credited service granted by the State Board;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">9. Participating municipality means a municipality which is making contributions to the System on behalf of its officers.

<p><font color="#000000">12. Permanent in-line disability means when a police officer serving in any capacity at a regular police department of a participating municipality becomes so physically or mentally disabled, as determined by an independent medical examiner, psychiatrist, or psychologist selected by the State Board, while in, and in consequence of, the performance of authorizing activities while on duty as an officer that he or she is unable to perform the required duties of a police officer;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">13. Beneficiary means a members surviving spouse or any surviving children, including biological and adopted children, at the time of the members death. The surviving spouse must have been married to the member for the thirty (30) continuous months immediately preceding the members death, provided a surviving spouse of a member who died while in, and as a consequence of, the performance of the members duty for a participating municipality, shall not be subject to the thirty-month marriage requirement for survivor benefits. A surviving child of a member shall be a beneficiary until reaching eighteen (18) years of age or twenty-two (22) years of age if the child is enrolled full-time and regularly attending a public or private school or any institution of higher education. Any child adopted by a member after the members retirement shall be a beneficiary only if the child is adopted by the member for the thirty (30) continuous months preceding the members death. Any child who is adopted by a member after the members retirement and such member dies accidentally or as a consequence of the performance of the members duty as a police officer shall not be subject to the thirty-month adoption requirement.

Effective July 1, 2016, the following shall apply in computing final average salary:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">b. for purposes of determining the normal disability benefit only, final average salary shall be based on the members total service if less than thirty (30) months,</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">c. in addition to other applicable limitations, and notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, for plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2002, the annual compensation of each noneligible member taken into account under the System shall not exceed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) annual compensation limit. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The annual compensation limit in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). For purposes of this section, a noneligible member is any member who first became a member during a plan year commencing on or after July 1, 1996,</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">e. effective January 1, 2008, back pay, within the meaning of Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8) of the Income Tax Regulations, shall be treated as paid base salary for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included in this definition;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">18. Accrued retirement benefit means, for benefits computed prior to the effective date of this act, two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the members final average salary multiplied by the members years of credited service not to exceed thirty (30) years.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">For a member who retires on or after the effective date of this act, accrued retirement benefit shall mean:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">a. for members who retire and terminate employment at least one (1) year after the effective date of this act, and have at least twenty-five (25) years of credited service, three percent (3%) of the members final average salary multiplied by the members years of credited service, not to exceed thirty (30) years,</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">b. for members who retire and terminate employment at least two (2) years after the effective date of this act, and have at least twenty (20) years of credited service, three percent (3%) of the members final average salary multiplied by the members years of credited service, not to exceed thirty (30) years,</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">19. Normal disability benefit means:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">a. for benefits computed prior to the effective date of this act, the greater of:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">(1) two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the members final average salary multiplied by twenty (20) years, notwithstanding the years of actual credited service, or</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">20. Limitation year means the year used in applying the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which year shall be the calendar year;</font></p>
