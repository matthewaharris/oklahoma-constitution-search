<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. 1. In the event of the death of a firefighter who at the time of the firefighter's death was drawing a pension, other than a disability pension, or who at the time of the firefighter's death (whether death occurred while on duty, but not in or in consequence of the performance of duty, or while on vacation or off duty) was eligible, upon written request, to retire and draw a pension, other than a disability pension, the beneficiary of such person shall be paid an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of said pension.</p>

<p>2. In the event of the death of a firefighter who at the time of the firefighter's death was drawing, or eligible to draw, a disability pension for a physical or mental disability that occurred while in, or in consequence of, the performance of the firefighter's duty, and which prevented the effective performance of the firefighter's duties, and which caused the State Board to retire the firefighter from active service, the beneficiary of such person shall be paid an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the pension paid in accordance with subsection A of Section 49-109 of this title.</p>

<p>3. In the event of the death of a firefighter who at the time of the firefighter's death was drawing, or eligible to draw, a disability pension for a physical or mental disability from causes not arising in the line of duty and which prevented the effective performance of the firefighter's duties, the beneficiary of such person shall be paid an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the pension paid in accordance with subsection C of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440094">Section 49-109</a> of this title.</p>

<p>4. If a firefighter, who does not have a surviving beneficiary, and to whom a retirement or disability benefit has been awarded, or who is eligible therefore, dies or, if later, the last surviving beneficiary dies, prior to receiving payments equal to or greater than the total contributions made by the employee, as defined in the next sentence, then a payment shall be made to the member's estate or, if applicable, the last surviving beneficiary's estate equal to the total contributions made by the employee minus the payments made including payments made, or to be made, from the Deferred Option Plan but excluding the death benefit pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76603">Section 49-113.2</a> of this title. The total contributions made by the employee for purposes of the prior sentence shall mean the sum of:</p>

<p>a. the member's accumulated contributions,</p>

<p>b. payments made to repurchase credited service pursuant to Section 49-117.1 of this title,</p>

<p>c. payments made to transfer credited service from another retirement system pursuant to subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76608">Section 49-117.2</a> or <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440096">Section 49-117.3</a> of this title, and</p>

<p>d. payments made to purchase prior military service credit pursuant to subsection E of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439332">Section 49-138</a> of this title.</p>

<p>Total contributions, as used in this paragraph, shall exclude interest earned or paid with respect to any contribution or payment described in subparagraphs a through d of this paragraph.</p>

<p>5. Any person eligible to receive a payment pursuant to this section may make an election to waive all or a portion of monthly payments.</p>

<p>B. In the event of the death of the surviving spouse, the pension shall cease, and should there then be but one living child same shall receive an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of said pension, but if there then be more than one living child, one hundred percent (100%) of said pension shall be divided equally between the children until each child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years or until the age of twenty-two (22) years if the child is enrolled full time and regularly attending a public or private school or any institution of higher education. Provided, that in the event the State Board finds that such a child who is not married at the time of death of the member or the member's surviving spouse and who at the time the child attains or attained the age of eighteen (18) years is either physically or mentally disabled, the pension thereof shall continue so long as such disability remains; provided, that upon the death of the firefighter and surviving spouse, if any, said physically or mentally disabled child shall be entitled to have paid to the child's trustee of a trust, whether inter vivos or testamentary, which trust provides for the receipt of the pension benefits to be held and administered for the sole benefit of said physically or mentally disabled child, or if there is no trust, to the child's legally appointed guardian, an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of said pension. The money so paid to the guardian or trustee shall be used solely for the benefit of the disabled child and it shall be reported annually to the State Board. A child shall not be considered disabled if the child is able to pursue a remunerative occupation, with the remuneration being reasonably substantial rather than merely nominal. The payment so provided shall be calculated after payments have been made to all eligible children as provided in this section; provided further, that beneficiaries now receiving pensions under the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76601">Sections 49-112</a> or 49-113 of this title shall, upon application to the State Board, thereafter be entitled to a pension equal to the amount which they would have received if this act were in effect at the time the right to said pension accrued.</p>

<p>C. In the event a surviving spouse of a member remarried prior to June 7, 1993, the surviving spouse shall be eligible to receive the pension benefits provided for in this section. To receive the pension benefits provided for in this section the surviving spouse falling within this section shall submit a written request for such benefits to the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System. The Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System shall approve requests by surviving spouses meeting the requirements of this section. Upon approval by the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System, the surviving spouse shall be entitled to the pension benefits provided for in this section beginning from the date of approval forward. Pension benefits provided to surviving spouses falling within this section shall not apply to alter any amount of pension benefits paid or due prior to the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System's approval of the remarried surviving spouse's written request for benefits.</p>

<p>D. No surviving spouse shall receive benefits from this section, <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439905">Section 50-117</a> of this title, or <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440176">Section 2-306 of Title 47</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes as the surviving spouse of more than one member of the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System, the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System, or the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System. The surviving spouse of more than one member shall elect which member's benefits he or she will receive.</p>

<p>E. Upon the death of a retired member, the benefit payment for the month in which the retired member died, if not previously paid, shall be made to the beneficiary of the member or to the member's estate if there is no beneficiary. Such benefit payment shall be made in an amount equal to a full monthly benefit payment regardless of the day of the month in which the retired member died.</p>

<p>F. Upon the death of an unmarried firefighter, or a firefighter whose spouse does not meet the qualifications of beneficiary who has one or more children, said child or children shall receive pension benefits as provided in subsection B of this section as if the surviving spouse had died; provided, that upon the death of the firefighter, said child or children shall be entitled to have the System pay to the child's or children's trustee of a trust, whether inter vivos or testamentary, which trust provides for the receipt of the pension benefits to be held and administered for the sole benefit of said child, or if there is no trust, to the child's or children's legally appointed guardian, the pension benefits as provided in subsection B of this section in an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of said pension. The money so paid to the guardian or trustee shall be used solely for the benefit of the child and it shall be reported annually to the State Board.</p>
