<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT size=2><FONT size=2>
<P>A. A municipal governing body may cause property within the municipal limits 
to be cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with 
the following procedure:</P>
<P>1. At least ten (10) days' notice shall be given to the owner of the property 
by mail at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the county 
treasurer's office before the governing body holds a hearing or takes action. 
The notice shall order the property owner to clean the property of trash, or to 
cut or mow the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate, and the notice 
shall further state that unless such work is performed within ten (10) days of 
the date of the notice the work shall be done by the municipality and a notice 
of lien shall be filed with the county clerk against the property for the costs 
due and owing the municipality. At the time of mailing of notice to the property 
owner, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal 
service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and 
address of the mailee. However, if the property owner cannot be located within 
ten (10) days from the date of mailing by the municipal governing body, notice 
may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property or by publication, 
as defined in Section 1-102 of this title, one time not less than ten (10) days 
prior to any hearing or action by the municipality. If a municipal governing 
body anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the 
provisions of subsection B of this section, the notice, whether by mail, posting 
or publication, shall state: that any accumulations of trash or excessive weed 
or grass growth on the owner's property occurring within six (6) months from and 
after the date of this notice may be summarily abated by the municipal governing 
body; that the costs of such abatement shall be assessed against the owner; and 
that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without 
further prior notice to the property owner;</P>
<P>2. The owner of the property may give written consent to the municipality 
authorizing the removal of the trash or the mowing of the weeds or grass. By 
giving written consent, the owner waives the owner's right to a hearing by the 
municipality;</P>
<P>3. A hearing may be held by the municipal governing body to determine whether 
the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass has caused the 
property to become detrimental to the health, benefit, and welfare of the public 
and the community or a hazard to traffic, or creates a fire hazard to the danger 
of property;</P>
<P>4. Upon a finding that the condition of the property constitutes a detriment 
or hazard, and that the property would be benefited by the removal of such 
conditions, the agents of the municipality are granted the right of entry on the 
property for the removal of trash, mowing of weeds or grass, and performance of 
the necessary duties as a governmental function of the municipality. Immediately 
following the cleaning or mowing of the property, the municipal clerk shall file 
a notice of lien with the county clerk describing the property and the work 
performed by the municipality, and stating that the municipality claims a lien 
on the property for the cleaning or mowing costs;</P>
<P>5. The governing body shall determine the actual cost of such cleaning and 
mowing and any other expenses as may be necessary in connection therewith, 
including the cost of notice and mailing. The municipal clerk shall forward by 
mail to the property owner specified in paragraph 1 of this subsection a 
statement of such actual cost and demanding payment. If the cleaning and mowing 
are done by the municipality, the cost to the property owner for the cleaning 
and mowing shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, maintenance, and 
equipment required. If the cleaning and mowing are done on a private contract 
basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder;</P>
<P>6. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the 
mailing of the statement, then within the next thirty (30) days, the municipal 
clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the 
county treasurer of the county in which the property is located and the same 
shall be levied on the property and collected by the county treasurer as other 
taxes authorized by law. Once certified by the county treasurer, payment may 
only be made to the county treasurer except as otherwise provided for in this 
section. In addition the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien against 
the property from the date the cost is certified to the county treasurer, 
coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special 
assessments and prior and superior to all other titles and liens against the 
property, and the lien shall continue until the cost shall be fully paid. At the 
time of collection the county treasurer shall collect a fee of Five Dollars 
($5.00) for each parcel of property. The fee shall be deposited to the credit of 
the general fund of the county. If the county treasurer and the municipality 
agree that the county treasurer is unable to collect the assessment, the 
municipality may pursue a civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and 
interest thereon by an action in person against the property owner and an action 
in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest, if 
severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface owner, shall not 
be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section. Upon 
receiving payment, if any, the municipal clerk shall forward to the county 
treasurer a notice of such payment and directing discharge of the lien; and</P>
<P>7. The municipality may designate by ordinance an administrative officer or 
administrative body to carry out the duties of the governing body in subsection 
A of this section. The property owner shall have a right of appeal to the 
municipal governing body from any order of the administrative officer or 
administrative body. Such appeal shall be taken by filing written notice of 
appeal with the municipal clerk within ten (10) days after the administrative 
order is rendered.</P>
<P>B. If a notice is given by a municipal governing body to a property owner 
ordering the property within the municipal limits to be cleaned of trash and 
weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with the procedures provided for 
in subsection A of this section, any subsequent accumulations of trash or 
excessive weed or grass growth on the property occurring within a six-month 
period may be declared to be a nuisance and may be summarily abated without 
further prior notice to the property owner. At the time of each such summary 
abatement the municipality shall notify the property owner of the abatement and 
the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request a 
hearing within ten (10) days after the date of mailing the notice. The notice 
and hearing shall be as provided for in subsection A of this section. Unless 
otherwise determined at the hearing the cost of such abatement shall be 
determined and collected as provided for in paragraphs 5 and 6 of subsection A 
of this section. This subsection shall not apply if the records of the county 
clerk show that the property was transferred after notice was given pursuant to 
subsection A of this section.</P>
<P>C. The municipal governing body may enact ordinances to prohibit owners of 
property or persons otherwise in possession or control located within the 
municipal limits from allowing trash to accumulate, or weeds to grow or stand 
upon the premises and may impose penalties for violation of said ordinances.</P>
<P>D. As used in this section:</P>
<P>1. "Weed" includes but is not limited to poison ivy, poison oak, or poison 
sumac and all vegetation at any state of maturity which:</P>
<P>a. exceeds twelve (12) inches in height, except healthy trees, shrubs, or 
produce for human consumption grown in a tended and cultivated garden unless 
such trees and shrubbery by their density or location constitute a detriment to 
the health, benefit and welfare of the public and community or a hazard to 
traffic or create a fire hazard to the property or otherwise interfere with the 
mowing of said weeds,</P>
<P>b. regardless of height, harbors, conceals, or invites deposits or 
accumulation of refuse or trash,</P>
<P>c. harbors rodents or vermin,</P>
<P>d. gives off unpleasant or noxious odors,</P>
<P>e. constitutes a fire or traffic hazard, or</P>
<P>f. is dead or diseased.</P>
<P>The term "weed" shall not include tended crops on land zoned for agricultural 
use which are planted more than one hundred fifty (150) feet from a parcel zoned 
for other than agricultural use;</P>
<P>2. "Trash" means any refuse, litter, ashes, leaves, debris, paper, 
combustible materials, rubbish, offal, or waste, or matter of any kind or form 
which is uncared for, discarded, or abandoned;</P>
<P>3. "Owner" means the owner of record as shown by the most current tax rolls 
of the county treasurer; and</P>
<P>4. "Cleaning" means the removal of trash from property.</P>
<P>E. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property zoned and 
used for agricultural purposes or to railroad property under the jurisdiction of 
the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. However, a municipal governing body may 
cause the removal of weeds or trash from property zoned and used for 
agricultural purposes pursuant to the provisions of this section but only if 
such weeds or trash pose a hazard to traffic and are located in, or within ten 
(10) yards of, the public right-of-way at 
intersections.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
