<P>A. For limitation years prior to July 1, 2007, the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall be computed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the System in effect at that time and, to the extent applicable, Revenue Ruling 98-1 and Revenue Ruling 2001-51, except as provided below. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary, the benefits payable to a member from the System provided by employer contributions (including contributions picked up by the employer under Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) shall be subject to the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in accordance with the provisions of this section and subsequent guidance. The limitations of this section shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided below.</P>
<P>B. Except as provided below, effective for limitation years ending after December 31, 2001, any accrued retirement benefit payable to a member as an annual benefit as described below shall not exceed One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000.00), automatically adjusted under Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for increases in the cost of living, as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate, effective January 1 of each calendar year and applicable to the limitation year ending with or within such calendar year. The automatic annual adjustment of the dollar limitation in this subsection under Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall apply to a member who has had a severance from employment.</P>
<P>1. The member's annual benefit is a benefit that is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. Except as provided below, where a benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, the benefit shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time as such other form of benefit and is payable on the first day of each month, before applying the limitations of this section. For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to Section 1.401(a)-20, Q&amp;A 10(d), and with regard to Section 1.415(b)-1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations.</P>
<P>2. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for:</P>
<P>a. survivor benefits payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and survivor annuity to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the member's benefit were paid in another form,</P>
<P>b. benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits), or</P>
<P>c. the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this section, and the System provides that the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this section applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form.</P>
<P>3. The determination of the annual benefit shall take into account Social Security supplements described in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant to Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&amp;A-3(c), of the Income Tax Regulations, but shall disregard benefits attributable to employee contributions or rollover contributions.</P>
<P>4. Effective for distributions in plan years beginning after December 31, 2003, the determination of actuarial equivalence of forms of benefit other than a straight life annuity shall be made in accordance with paragraph 5 or paragraph 6 of this subsection.</P>
<P>5. Benefit Forms Not Subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended: The straight life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member's form of benefit shall be determined under this paragraph 5 if the form of the member's benefit is either:</P>
<P>a. a nondecreasing annuity (other than a straight life annuity) payable for a period of not less than the life of the member (or, in the case of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, the life of the surviving spouse), or</P>
<P>b. an annuity that decreases during the life of the member merely because of:</P>
<P>(1) the death of the survivor annuitant (but only if the reduction is not below fifty percent (50%) of the benefit payable before the death of the survivor annuitant), or</P>
<P>(2) the cessation or reduction of Social Security supplements or qualified disability payments (as defined in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended).</P>
<P>c. Limitation Years Beginning Before July 1, 2007. For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount:</P>
<P>(1) the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor), each as set forth in subsection G of Section 50-105.4 of this title for adjusting benefits in the same form, and</P>
<P>(2) a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable) for that annuity starting date.</P>
<P>d. Limitation Year Beginning On January 1, 2008. For the limitation year beginning on January 1, 2008, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of:</P>
<P>(1) the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the System commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit, and</P>
<P>(2) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable) for that annuity starting date.</P>
<P>e. Limitation Years Beginning On or After July 1, 2008. For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2008, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of:</P>
<P>(1) the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the System commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit, and</P>
<P>(2) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table within the meaning of Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as described in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 (and subsequent guidance) for that annuity starting date.</P>
<P>6. Benefit Forms Subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended: The straight life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member's form of benefit shall be determined under this paragraph 6 if the form of the member's benefit is other than a benefit form described in paragraph 5 of this subsection. In this case, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity shall be determined as follows:</P>
<P>a. Annuity Starting Date on or after January 1, 2009. If the annuity starting date of the member's form of benefit is in the period beginning on January 1, 2009, through June 30, 2009, or in a plan year beginning after June 30, 2009, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of (1), (2) and (3) below:</P>
<P>(1) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) as set forth in the most recent actuarial valuation referenced in subsection G of Section 50-105.4 of this title prior to September 1, 2011, and effective September 1, 2011, in paragraph 22 of Section 50-101 of this title, for adjusting benefits in the same form,</P>
<P>(2) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five and one-half percent (5.5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table within the meaning of Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as described in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 (and subsequent guidance), and</P>
<P>(3) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using:</P>
<P>(a) the applicable interest rate under Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (and subsequent guidance), for the fourth calendar month preceding the plan year in which falls the annuity starting date for the distribution and the stability period is the successive period of one (1) plan year which contains the annuity starting date for the distribution and for which the applicable interest rate remains constant, or as otherwise provided in the applicable guidance if the first day of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2007, does not coincide with the first day of the applicable stability period, and</P>
<P>(b) the applicable mortality table within the meaning of Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as described in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 (and subsequent guidance),</P>
<P>divided by one and five one-hundredths (1.05).</P>

If the annuity starting date of the member's form of benefit is in the period beginning on July 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of (1), (2) and (3) below:</P>
<P>(1) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) each as set forth in subsection G of Section 50-105.4 of this title for adjusting benefits in the same form,</P>
<P>(2) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five and one-half percent (5.5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable), and</P>
<P>(3) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using:</P>
<P>(a) the adjusted first, second, and third segment rates under Section 417(e)(3)(C) and (D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applied under rules similar to the rules of Section 430(h)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the fourth calendar month preceding the plan year in which falls the annuity starting date for the distribution and the stability period is the successive period of one (1) plan year which contains the annuity starting date for the distribution and for which the applicable interest rate remains constant, or as otherwise provided in the applicable guidance if the first day of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2007, does not coincide with the first day of the applicable stability period, and</P>
<P>(b) the applicable mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable),</P>
<P>divided by one and five one-hundredths (1.05).</P>
<P>c. Annuity Starting Date in Plan Years Beginning in 2006 or 2007. If the annuity starting date of the member's form of benefit is in a Plan Year beginning in 2006 or 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of (1), (2) and (3) below:</P>
<P>(1) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) each as set forth in subsection G of Section 50-105.4 of this title for adjusting benefits in the same form,</P>

<P>(b) the applicable mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable),</P>
<P>divided by one and five one-hundredths (1.05).</P>

<P>(b) a five and one-half percent (5.5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable).</P>
<P>(2) If the annuity starting date of the member's benefit is on or after the first day of the first plan year beginning in 2004 and before December 31, 2004, the application of this subparagraph shall not cause the amount payable under the member's form of benefit to be less than the benefit calculated under the System, taking into account the limitations of this section, except that the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using whichever of the following produces the greatest annual amount:</P>

<P>(ii) the applicable mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable).</P>
<P>C. If a member has less than ten (10) years of participation in the System and all predecessor municipal police pension and retirement systems, the dollar limitation otherwise applicable under subsection B of this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the years of participation, or part thereof, in the System of the member, but never less than one (1), and the denominator of which is ten (10).</P>
<P>D. Adjustment of Dollar Limitation for Benefit Commencement Before Age Sixty-two (62) or After Age Sixty-five (65): Effective for benefits commencing in limitation years ending after December 31, 2001, the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section shall be adjusted if the annuity starting date of the member's benefit is before age sixty-two (62) or after age sixty-five (65).

<P>(1) the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) each as set forth in subsection G of Section 50-105.4 of this title, or</P>
<P>(2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable).</P>
<P>b. Limitation Years Beginning On or After July 1, 2007.</P>
<P>(1) System Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age Sixty-two (62) and the Age of Benefit Commencement.</P>
<P>(a) If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is prior to age sixty-two (62) and occurs in the limitation year beginning on January 1, 2008, and the System does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation for the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section (adjusted under subsection C of this section for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the annuity starting date as described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable) (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date).</P>
<P>(b) If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is prior to age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and the System does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation for the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section (adjusted under subsection C of this section for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table within the meaning of Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as described in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 (and subsequent guidance) (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date).</P>
<P>(2) System Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age Sixty-two (62) and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is prior to age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the System has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation for the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under division (1) of subparagraph b of this paragraph and the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section (adjusted under subsection C of this section for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the System at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the System at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of this section.</P>
<P>(3) Effective for limitation years commencing on or after January 1, 2014, notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph 1 of this subsection, the age-adjusted dollar limit applicable to a member shall not decrease on account of an increase in age or the performance of additional services.</P>
<P>2. Adjustment of Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation for Benefit Commencement After Age Sixty-five (65):</P>
<P>a. Limitation Years Beginning Before July 1, 2007. If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the dollar limitation for the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section (adjusted under subsection C of this section for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount:</P>
<P>(1) the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) each as set forth in subsection G of Section 50-105.4 of this title, or</P>
<P>(2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable).</P>
<P>b. Limitation Years Beginning On or After July 1, 2007.</P>
<P>(1) System Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age Sixty-five (65) and the Age of Benefit Commencement.</P>
<P>(a) If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in the limitation year beginning on January 1, 2008, and the System does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section (adjusted under subsection C of this section for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the annuity starting date as described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 (or its successor for these purposes, if applicable) (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date).</P>
<P>(b) If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and the System does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section (adjusted under subsection C of this section for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table within the meaning of Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as described in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 (and subsequent guidance) (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date).</P>
<P>(2) System Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age Sixty-five (65) and Age of Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the System has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under division (1) of subparagraph b of this paragraph and the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section (adjusted under subsection C of this section for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the System at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the System at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the System at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the System at age sixty-five (65) is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the System to a hypothetical member who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same accrued benefit as the member.</P>
<P>3. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subsection, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation under subsection B of this section to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and age sixty-two (62), or between age sixty-five (65) and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member's death if the System does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Section 417(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, upon the member's death.</P>
<P>4. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, if payment begins before the member reaches age sixty-two (62), the reductions in the limitations in this subsection shall not apply to a member who is a "qualified participant" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</P>
<P>E. Minimum Benefit Permitted: Notwithstanding anything else in this section to the contrary, the benefit otherwise accrued or payable to a member under this System shall be deemed not to exceed the maximum permissible benefit if:</P>
<P>1. The retirement benefits payable for a limitation year under any form of benefit with respect to such member under this System and under all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether a plan has been terminated) ever maintained by a participating municipality do not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction:</P>
<P>a. the numerator of which is the member's number of credited years (or part thereof, but not less than one (1) year) of service (not to exceed ten (10) years) with the participating municipality, and</P>
<P>b. the denominator of which is ten (10); and</P>
<P>2. The participating municipality (or a predecessor employer) has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the member participated (for this purpose, mandatory employee contributions under a defined benefit plan, individual medical accounts under Section 401(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and accounts for postretirement medical benefits established under Section 419A(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are not considered a separate defined contribution plan).</P>
<P>F. In no event shall the maximum annual accrued retirement benefit of a member allowable under this section be less than the annual amount of such accrued retirement benefit, including early pension and qualified joint and survivor annuity amounts, duly accrued by the member as of the last day of the limitation year beginning in 1982, or as of the last day of the limitation year beginning in 1986, whichever is greater, disregarding any plan changes or cost-of-living adjustments occurring after July 1, 1982, as to the 1982 accrued amount, and May 5, 1986, as to the 1986 accrued amount.</P>
<P>G. If a member purchases service credit under the System, which qualifies as "permissive service credit" pursuant to Section 415(n) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may be met by either:</P>
<P>1. Treating the accrued benefit derived from such contributions as an annual benefit under subsection B of this section; or</P>
<P>2. Treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Section 415(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</P>
<P>H. If a member repays to the System any amounts refunded from the System because of such member's prior termination or any other amount which qualifies as a repayment under Section 415(k)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such repayment shall not be taken into account for purposes of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pursuant to Section 415(k)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</P>
<P>I. For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 1995, subsection C of this section, paragraph 1 of subsection D of this section, and the proration provided under subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 1 of subsection E of this section shall not apply to a benefit paid under the System as the result of the member becoming disabled by reason of personal injuries or sickness, or amounts received by the beneficiaries, survivors or estate of the member as the result of the death of the member.</P>
<P>J. For distributions made in limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2000, the combined limit of repealed Section 415(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall not apply.</P>
<P>K. The State Board is hereby authorized to revoke the special election previously made on June 19, 1991, under Section 415(b)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</P>
<P>L. All benefits payable from the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System, including payments from the deferred option plans under Section 50-111.3 of this title, shall be paid from the general assets of the Fund pursuant to subsection B of Section 50-105.6 of this title.</P><B><I>
