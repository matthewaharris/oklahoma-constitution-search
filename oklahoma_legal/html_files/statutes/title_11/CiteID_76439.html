<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Corporations referred to in this article as urban 
redevelopment corporations shall be organized in the following manner: The 
articles of agreement or association shall be prepared, subscribed and 
acknowledged, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State pursuant to the 
general corporation laws of the state and shall contain: (1) The name of the 
proposed corporation, which must have the words "redevelopment corporation" as a 
part thereof; (2) The purposes for which it is formed, which shall be to 
acquire, construct, maintain and operate a redevelopment project or 
redevelopment projects in accordance with the provisions of this article; (3) 
The amount of the capital stock, and if any be preferred stock, the preference 
thereof; (4) The number of shares of which the capital shall consist, all of 
which shall have a par value; (5) The municipality in which its principal 
business office is to be located; (6) Its duration, which shall not exceed 
ninety-nine (99) years; (7) The number of directors, which shall not be less 
than three (3), nor more than thirteen (13); (8) The names and post office 
addresses of the directors for the first year, at least one of whom shall be a 
resident of the State of Oklahoma; (9) The names and post office addresses of 
the subscribers to the articles of association or agreement; (10) A provision 
that in the event that income debenture certificates are issued by a 
corporation, the owners thereof shall have the same right to vote as they would 
have if possessed of certificates of stock of the amount and par value of the 
income debenture certificates held by them. The articles may provide for the 
retirement of income debenture certificates or preferred stock of the 
corporation as and when there shall be funds available in the treasury of the 
corporation from the receipt of amortization of sinking fund installments for 
that purpose; and (11) A declaration that the corporation has been organized to 
serve a public purpose; that all real estate acquired by it and all structures 
erected by it are to be acquired for the purpose of promoting the public health, 
safety, and welfare, and that such corporation is organized for the purpose of 
clearing, replanning, reconstructing or rehabilitating blighted areas, and the 
construction of such industrial, commercial, residential or public structure as 
may be appropriate including provisions for recreational and other facilities 
incidental or appurtenant thereto. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. No corporation now organized under the laws of 
this state shall change its name to a name, and no such corporation hereafter 
organized shall have a name, containing the word "redevelopment" as a part 
thereof except as provided in this article. No foreign corporation now 
authorized to do business in this state shall change its name to a name, and no 
such corporation shall hereafter be authorized to do business in the state with 
a name, containing the word "redevelopment" as a part thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. An urban redevelopment corporation may operate 
under this article on one or more redevelopment projects and, with respect to 
each such project, shall have such rights, powers, duties, and immunities and 
obligations, not inconsistent with the provisions of this article, as may be 
granted to it by an agreement to operate and to execute an urban renewal plan or 
any portion thereof. The agreement to operate may be entered between the 
redevelopment corporation and any municipality or Urban Renewal Authority. The 
agreement shall provide, among other things, that the corporation is to carry 
out the purposes of the urban renewal plan for the project area, and to devote 
such property as it may acquire, to uses specified in the urban renewal plan and 
shall contain provisions deemed to be necessary or desirable to assist in 
preventing the development or spread of future blight or otherwise carry out the 
purposes of this article. The agreement shall contain such requirements as the 
municipality or Urban Renewal Authority may determine to be in the public 
interest, including the obligation to begin to execute the redevelopment plan 
within a reasonable time. The agreement to operate may provide that the 
redevelopment corporation is to prepare a renewal plan; however, execution of 
the plan shall not proceed until such plan is adopted by the municipality as 
required in this article. The agreement may require the redevelopment 
corporation to furnish a performance bond for an amount to be determined by the 
municipality or the Urban Renewal Authority whichever the case may be.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The provisions of the general corporation law, as 
presently in effect and as hereafter from time to time amended, shall apply to 
urban redevelopment corporations, except where such provisions are in conflict 
with the provisions of this article.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. In the event that any action with respect to which 
the holders of income debentures shall have the right to vote is proposed to be 
taken, notice of any meeting at which such action is proposed to be taken shall 
be given to such holders in the same manner and to the same extent as if they 
were stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting. Any 
articles filed pursuant to law in the office of the Secretary of State with 
respect to any such action, and any affidavit required by law to be annexed to 
such articles shall contain the same statements or recitals. The articles shall 
be subscribed and acknowledged, and such affidavit shall be made, in the same 
manner as if such debenture holders were stockholders holding shares of an 
additional class of stock entitled to vote on such action, or with respect to 
the proceedings provided in such document.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. An urban redevelopment corporation shall establish 
and maintain depreciation, obsolescence, and other reserves, also surplus and 
other accounts, including, among others, a reserve for the payment of taxes 
according to recognized standard accounting practices.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. No urban redevelopment corporation shall pay any 
interest on its income debentures or dividends on its stock during any dividend 
year unless there shall exist at the time of such payment no default under any 
amortization requirements with respect to its indebtedness, or unless all 
accrued interest, taxes and other public charges shall have been duly paid or 
reserves set up for payment therefor, and adequate reserves provided for 
depreciation, obsolescence and other proper reserves.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. The real property, title of which is vested in an 
urban redevelopment corporation, shall be subject to the payment of general ad 
valorem taxes imposed by the state or any political subdivision thereof.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. Notwithstanding any requirement of law to the 
contrary, or the absence of direct provision therefor in the instrument under 
which a fiduciary is acting, any of the following persons, partnerships, or 
corporations, and public bodies or public officers, owning or holding any real 
property within any blighted area proposed to be cleared or redeveloped by an 
urban redevelopment corporation, may grant, sell, lease or otherwise transfer 
any such real property to an urban redevelopment corporation, and receive and 
hold any cash, mortgages, or other securities or obligations exchanged therefor 
by such urban redevelopment corporation, and may execute such instruments and do 
such acts as may be deemed necessary or desirable by them or to and by the urban 
redevelopment corporation in connection with the execution of any urban renewal 
plan: (1) Every executor, administrator, trustee, guardian or any other person 
holding trust funds or acting in a fiduciary capacity, unless the instrument 
under which such fiduciary is acting expressly forbids; (2) The state, its 
subdivisions, municipalities, all other public bodies, and all public officers; 
(3) Persons, partnerships and corporations, organized under or subject to the 
provisions of the banking and trust laws (including savings banks, savings and 
loan associations, trust companies, private bankers and private banking 
corporations); (4) The State Bank Commissioner or the Commissioner of Securities 
as conservator, liquidator, or rehabilitator of any such person, partnership, or 
corporation.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. An urban redevelopment corporation may acquire 
real property or secure options in its own name or in the name of nominees, or 
it may acquire real property by gift, grant, lease, purchase, lease-purchase, or 
otherwise.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. When title to real property has been vested in an 
urban redevelopment corporation, the urban redevelopment corporation may agree 
with the previous owners of such property, or any tenants continuing to occupy 
or use it, or any other persons who may occupy or use or seek to occupy or use 
such property, that such former owner, tenant, or other persons may occupy or 
use such property upon the payment periodically of an agreed sum of money. Such 
occupation or use shall not be construed as a tenancy from month to month, nor 
require the giving of notice by the urban redevelopment corporation for the 
termination of such occupation or use of the right to such occupation or use, 
but immediately upon the expiration of the term for which payment has been made 
the urban redevelopment corporation shall be entitled to possession of the real 
property and may maintain an action for either unlawful detainer or ejectment 
for the purpose of recovering immediate possession thereof.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>L. An urban redevelopment corporation may borrow 
funds and secure the repayment thereof by mortgage which shall contain 
reasonable amortization provisions and shall be a lien upon no other real 
property except that forming the whole or a part of a single development area. 
Certificates, bonds and notes, or part interest therein, or any part of an issue 
thereof, which are secured by a first mortgage on the real property in an urban 
renewal area, or any part thereof, shall be securities in which all the 
following persons, partnerships, or corporations and public bodies or public 
officers may legally invest the funds within their control: (1) Every executor, 
administrator, trustee, guardian, committee or other person or corporation 
holding trust funds or acting in a fiduciary capacity; (2) Persons, partnerships 
and corporations organized under or subject to the provisions of the banking law 
(including savings banks, savings and loan associations and trust companies); 
(3) The State Bank Commissioner or the Commissioner of Securities as 
conservator, liquidator, or rehabilitator of any such person, partnership or 
corporation; (4) Persons, partnerships, or corporations organized under or 
subject to the provisions of the insurance law; (5) Fraternal benefit societies; 
and (6) The State Commissioner of Insurance as conservator, liquidator, or 
rehabilitator of any such person, partnership or corporation. Any mortgage on 
the real property in an urban renewal area, or any part thereof, may create a 
first lien, or a second or other junior lien, upon such real property.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>M. Any urban redevelopment corporation may lease, 
sell, grant, dedicate or otherwise dispose of any or all of the real property 
acquired by it for the purposes of a redevelopment project. In the event of the 
sale by reason of foreclosure or other disposition of real property of any urban 
redevelopment corporation by voluntary transfer or otherwise, or by reason of 
the foreclosure of any mortgage or other lien, through insolvency or bankruptcy 
proceedings, by order of any court of competent jurisdiction, by voluntary 
transfer or otherwise, the purchaser of such real property of such redevelopment 
corporation shall continue to use, operate and maintain such real property in 
accordance with the provisions of the urban renewal plan.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>N. Any urban redevelopment corporation may accept 
grants or loans of money from the Federal Government or any department or agency 
thereof.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>O. Any corporation organized under the laws of the 
State of Oklahoma, or admitted to do business in the State of Oklahoma, shall
