<p>A. &nbsp;Any member who has heretofore left the Police Department qualifying under this article to enter the military service of the United States during World War II and who returned to said department on or before July 1, 1947, or the Korean conflict and who returned to said department on or before January 1, 1956, shall receive credit for such time in military service without having made contribution to the System; and any member who has heretofore left, or hereafter may leave said department because of involuntary conscription into the military services of the United States at any time and who returns to said department within ninety (90) days after the member's release from such involuntary service shall receive credit for such time in said military service on the Police Department without having made contribution to the System only for that period that is involuntary; voluntary enlistments and voluntary extensions of military service being herewith specifically excluded for retirement credit.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;A member who began participation in the System prior to July 1, 2003, and who retires on or after July 1, 1998, shall be entitled to prior service credit, not to exceed five (5) years, for those periods of military service on active duty prior to membership in the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System. &nbsp;All members who initially begin participation with the System after June 30, 2003, may acquire prior military service credit for a maximum of five (5) years of such service credit upon payment of the actuarial cost of such service in the manner prescribed by and subject to all of the requirements of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440056">Section 50-111.4</a> of this title. &nbsp;For members of the System hired or rehired on or after July 1, 2003, if the military service credit authorized by this subsection is used to compute the retirement benefit of the member and the member retires from the System, such military service credit shall not be used to compute the retirement benefit in any other retirement system created pursuant to the Oklahoma Statutes and the member may receive credit for such service only in the retirement system from which the member first retires.</p>

<p>For purposes of this subsection, "military service" means service in the Armed Forces of the United States by honorably discharged persons during the following time periods, as reflected on such person's Defense Department Form 214, as follows:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;During the following periods, including the beginning and ending dates, and only for the periods served, from:</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;April 6, 1917, to November 11, 1918, commonly referred to as World War I,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;September 16, 1940, to December 7, 1941, as a member of the 45th Division,</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;December 7, 1941, to December 31, 1946, commonly referred to as World War II,</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;June 27, 1950, to January 31, 1955, commonly referred to as the Korean Conflict or the Korean War,</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;February 28, 1961, to May 7, 1975, commonly referred to as the Vietnam era, except that:</p>

<p>(1) &nbsp;for the period from February 28, 1961, to August 4, 1964, military service shall only include service in the Republic of Vietnam during that period, and</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;for purposes of determining eligibility for education and training benefits, such period shall end on December 31, 1976, or</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;August 1, 1990, to December 31, 1991, commonly referred to as the Gulf War, the Persian Gulf War, or Operation Desert Storm, but excluding any person who served on active duty for training only, unless discharged from such active duty for a service-connected disability;</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;During a period of war or combat military operation other than a conflict, war or era listed in paragraph 1 of this subsection, beginning on the date of Congressional authorization, Congressional resolution, or Executive Order of the President of the United States, for the use of the Armed Forces of the United States in a war or combat military operation, if such war or combat military operation lasted for a period of ninety (90) days or more, for a person who served, and only for the period served, in the area of responsibility of the war or combat military operation, but excluding a person who served on active duty for training only, unless discharged from such active duty for a service-connected disability, and provided that the burden of proof of military service during this period shall be with the member, who must present appropriate documentation establishing such service.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;An eligible member pursuant to subsection B of this section shall include only those persons who shall have served during the times or in the areas prescribed thereunder and only if such person provides appropriate documentation in such time and manner as required by the System to establish such military service prescribed in this section, or for service pursuant to division (1) of subparagraph e of paragraph 1 of subsection B of this section, those persons who were awarded service medals, as authorized by the United States Department of Defense as reflected in the veteran's Defense Department Form 214, related to the Vietnam Conflict for service prior to August 5, 1964. &nbsp;The provisions of subsection B of this section shall include military retirees, whose retirement was based only on active service, that have been rated as having twenty percent (20%) or greater service-connected disability by the Veterans Administration or the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;Effective December 12, 1994, a leave of absence on account of a period of "qualified military service" in the uniformed services of the United States (within the meaning of Section 414(u)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), followed by a return to the service of the participating municipality within ninety (90) days after the completion of the period of service, shall constitute credited service. &nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary:</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;Contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service shall be provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended (USERRA). &nbsp;The municipality's contributions to the System for a member covered by USERRA are due when such a member makes up his or her contributions that were missed due to his or her qualified military service; and</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;Effective January 1, 2007, if any member dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), the survivors of the member are entitled to any additional benefits other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service provided under the System had the member resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;Any member who served in any branch of the United States Armed Forces or any component thereof, who was honorably discharged, and who began participation in the System on or after November 1, 2022, shall be entitled to prior service credit, not to exceed five (5) years, upon payment of the actuarial cost of such service in the manner prescribed by and subject to all of the requirements of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440056">Section 50-111.4</a> of this title. &nbsp;For purposes of this subsection, "military service" means service in the Armed Forces of the United States by honorably discharged persons.</p>
