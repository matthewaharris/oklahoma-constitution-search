<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. After a building has been declared dilapidated, as 
provided in Section </FONT><A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76045"><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>22-112</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> of this title, and 
before the commencement of the tearing and removal of a dilapidated building, 
the governing body of any municipality may authorize that such a building be 
boarded and secured. However, if the dilapidated building is vacant and unfit 
for human occupancy, the governing body of any municipality may authorize the 
structure to be demolished pursuant to Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76045"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>22-112</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this 
title.</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. A governing body of any municipality may cause the 
premises on which an unsecured building is located to be cleaned of trash and 
weeds in accordance with the provisions of Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76044"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>22-111</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this 
title.</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. A governing body of any municipality may cause an 
unsecured building to be boarded and secured in accordance with the following 
procedures: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Before the governing body orders such action, at 
least ten (10) days' notice that such unsecured building is to be boarded and 
secured shall be given by mail to any property owners and mortgage holders as 
provided in Section </FONT><A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76045"><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>22-112</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> of this title. At 
the time of mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage holder, the 
municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which 
receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the 
mailee. A copy of the notice shall also be posted on the property to be 
affected. However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be 
located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property or 
by publication as defined in Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=75748"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>1-102</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this title. Such notice 
shall be published one time, not less than ten (10) days prior to any hearing or 
action by the municipality pursuant to the provisions of this section. If a 
municipal governing body anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of this subsection, the notice 
shall state: that any subsequent need for boarding and securing the building 
within a six-month period after the initial boarding and securing of the 
building pursuant to such notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the 
municipal governing body; that the costs of such boarding and securing shall be 
assessed against the owner; and that a lien may be imposed on the property to 
secure such payment, all without further prior notice to the property owner or 
mortgage holder;</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The owner of the property may give written consent 
to the municipality authorizing the boarding and securing of such unsecured 
building and to the payment of any costs incurred thereby. By giving written 
consent, the owner waives any right the owner has to a hearing by the municipal 
governing body; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If the property owner does not give written 
consent to such actions, a hearing may be held by the municipal governing body 
to determine whether the boarding and securing of such unsecured building would 
promote and benefit the public health, safety or welfare. Such hearing may be 
held in conjunction with a hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of 
weeds or grass on the premises of such unsecured building held pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraph 3 of subsection A of Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76044"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>22-111</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this title. In making 
such determination, the governing body shall apply the following standard: the 
governing body may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured building 
when the boarding and securing thereof would make such building less available 
for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such building, or 
decrease the hazard that such building would constitute an attractive nuisance 
to children.</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Upon making the required determination, the municipal 
governing body may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured building; 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. After the governing body orders the boarding and 
securing of such unsecured building, the municipal clerk shall immediately file 
a notice of unsecured building and lien with the county clerk describing the 
property, stating the findings of the municipality at the hearing at which such 
building was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the municipality 
claims a lien on the property for the costs of boarding and securing such 
building and that such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner 
from and after the date of filing the notice; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Pursuant to the order of the governing body, the 
agents of the municipality are granted the right of entry on the property for 
the performance of the boarding and securing of such building and for the 
performance of all necessary duties as a governmental function of the 
municipality; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. After an unsecured building has been boarded and 
secured, the governing body shall determine the actual costs of such actions and 
any other expenses that may be necessary in conjunction therewith including the 
cost of the notice and mailing. The municipal clerk shall forward a statement of 
the actual costs attributable to the boarding and securing of the unsecured 
building and a demand for payment of such costs, by mail to any property owners 
and mortgage holders as provided in Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76045"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>22-112</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this title. At the 
time of mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner or mortgage 
holder, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal 
service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and 
address of the mailee.</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If a municipality boards and secures any unsecured 
building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of the 
labor, materials and equipment required for the performance of such actions. If 
such actions are done on a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded 
to the lowest and best bidder; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. When payment is made to the municipality for costs 
incurred, the municipal clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment 
attributable to the actual costs of the boarding and securing of the unsecured 
building is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of the 
statement to the owner of such property, the municipal clerk shall forward a 
certified statement of the amount of the costs to the county treasurer of the 
county in which the property is located. Once certified to the county treasurer, 
payment may only be made to the county treasurer except as otherwise provided 
for in this section. At the time of collection the county treasurer shall 
collect a fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) for each parcel of property and such fee 
shall be deposited to the general fund of the county. The costs shall be levied 
on the property and collected by the county treasurer as are other taxes 
authorized by law. Until fully paid, the costs and the interest thereon shall be 
the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date the notice 
of unsecured building and lien is filed with the county clerk. In addition the 
costs and the interest thereon shall be a lien against the property from the 
date the notice of the lien is filed with the county clerk. The lien shall be 
coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special 
assessments and shall be prior and superior to all other titles and liens 
against the property. The lien shall continue until the costs and interest are 
fully paid. If the county treasurer and the municipality agree that the county 
treasurer is unable to collect the assessment, the municipality may pursue a 
civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon by an 
action in personam against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose 
its lien against the property. A mineral interest if severed from the surface 
owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this 
section. Upon receiving payment, the municipal clerk shall forward to the county 
treasurer a notice of such payment and shall direct discharge of the lien; 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. The municipality may designate by ordinance an 
administrative officer or administrative body to carry out the duties of the 
governing body specified in subsection C of this section. The property owner or 
mortgage holder shall have a right of appeal to the municipal governing body 
from any order of the administrative officer or administrative body. Such appeal 
shall be taken by filing written notice of appeal with the municipal clerk 
within ten (10) days after the administrative order is rendered; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. If a municipal governing body causes a structure 
within the municipal limits to be boarded and secured, any subsequent need for 
boarding and securing within a six-month period constitutes a public nuisance 
and may be summarily boarded and secured without further prior notice to the 
property owner or mortgage holder. At the time of each such summary boarding and 
securing, the municipality shall notify the property owner and mortgage holder 
of the boarding and securing and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that 
the property owner may request an appeal with the municipal clerk within ten 
(10) days after the mailing of the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as 
provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection. Unless otherwise determined at 
the hearing the cost of such boarding and securing shall be determined and 
collected as provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this subsection; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. A governing body of any municipality may 
determine that a building is unsecured and order that such building be boarded 
and secured in the manner provided for in this subsection even though such 
building has not been declared, by the governing body, to be dilapidated; and 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. For the purposes of this subsection: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. "boarding and securing" or "boarded and secured" 
means the closing, boarding or locking of any or all exterior openings so as to 
prevent entry into the structure, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. "unsecured building" shall mean any structure 
which is not occupied by a legal or equitable owner thereof, or by a lessee of a 
legal or equitable owner, and into which there are one or more unsecured 
openings such as broken windows, unlocked windows, broken doors, unlocked doors, 
holes in exterior walls, holes in the roof, broken basement or cellar hatchways, 
unlocked basement or cellar hatchways or other similar unsecured openings which 
would facilitate an unauthorized entry into the structure, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. "unfit for human occupancy" means a structure that 
due to lack of necessary repairs is considered uninhabitable and is a hazard to 
the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to 
any property zoned and used for agricultural purposes. </FONT></P><B><I>
