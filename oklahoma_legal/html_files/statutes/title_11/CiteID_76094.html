<P>A. Purposes. The Authority may issue bonds in such principal amounts as the 
Authority deems necessary to provide sufficient funds to perform any of its 
corporate purposes and powers including, without limitation, the acquisition, 
construction, or termination of any project to be owned or leased, as lessor or 
lessee, by the Authority or the acquisition of any interest therein or any right 
to the products or services thereof, the funding or refunding of the principal 
of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on, any bonds issued by the 
Authority whether the bonds or interest to be funded or refunded have or have 
not become due, the payment of engineering, legal, and other expenses, together 
with interest subsequent to the estimated date of completion of the project for 
such period of time as the Board of Directors determines appropriate, the 
establishment or increase of reserves to secure or to pay the bonds or interest 
thereon, the providing of working capital, and the payment of, and the 
establishment or increase of reserves for, all other costs or expenses of the 
Authority incident to, and necessary or convenient to perform, its corporate 
purposes and powers.</P>
<P>B. Security for Bonds. Every issue of bonds of the Authority shall be payable 
out of the revenues or funds of the Authority, subject to any agreements with 
the holders of particular bonds pledging any particular revenues or funds. The 
Authority may issue such types of bonds as it may determine to be appropriate, 
including bonds as to which the principal and interest are payable exclusively 
from the revenues from one or more projects, or from an interest therein or a 
right to the products and services thereof, or from one or more 
revenue-producing contracts made by the Authority with any person, or its 
revenues generally. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge or 
assignment of any revenue-producing contracts made by the Authority with any 
person or of any grant, subsidy, or contribution from any person or a pledge of 
any income or revenues, funds, or monies of the Authority from any source.</P>
<P>C. Negotiability. All bonds of the Authority shall have all the qualities of 
negotiable instruments pursuant to the laws of this state.</P>
<P>D. Bond Provisions. Bonds of the Authority shall be authorized by a 
resolution adopted by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors then 
in office and may be issued pursuant to the bond resolution or pursuant to a 
trust indenture or other security agreement, in one or more series, and shall 
bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, bear interest at such 
rate or rates which may be fixed or may change at such time or times and in 
accordance with such formula or method of determination. The bonds shall also be 
in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such conversion, registration, 
and exchange privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, 
be payable in such medium of payment at such place or places within or without 
this state, be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium, and 
contain or be subject to such other terms as the bond resolution, trust 
indenture, or other security agreement may provide. The bonds shall not be 
restricted by the provisions of any other law limiting the amounts, maturities, 
interest rates, or other terms of obligations of eligible public agencies or 
private persons. The bonds shall be sold, in such manner as the Board of 
Directors shall determine, at public or private sale. The Board of Directors may 
also authorize bonds to be issued and sold from time to time and may delegate to 
such officer or agent of the Authority as the Board of Directors selects the 
power to determine the time and manner of sale, public or private, the 
maturities and rate or rates of interest which may be fixed or may vary at such 
time or times and in accordance with a specified formula or method of 
determination, provided that the interest cost of the money received from the 
sale of the bonds computed to maturity in accordance with standard bond tables 
in general use by banks and insurance companies shall not exceed the maximum 
rate of interest provided for in this section. The bonds shall be subject to 
such other terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the officer or agent; 
provided, however, that the amounts and maturities of, and the interest rate or 
rates not exceeding the maximum rate of interest provided for in this section 
on, the bonds shall be within the limits prescribed by the Board of Directors in 
its resolution delegating to the officer or agent the power to authorize the 
sale and issuance of the bonds.</P>
<P>E. Execution of Bonds. Bonds of the Authority may be issued and delivered 
notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the officers executing them shall 
have ceased to hold office at the time the bonds are actually delivered.</P>
<P>F. Temporary Bonds. Pending preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority 
may issue temporary bonds which shall be exchanged for the definitive bonds.</P>
<P>G. Consents. Bonds of the Authority may be issued pursuant to the provisions 
of the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority Act without obtaining the consent of 
any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of this state and 
without any other proceeding, condition, or occurrence except as specifically 
required by the provisions of the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority Act.</P>
<P>H. Official Statement, Prospectus or Offering Document; Filing. At least five 
(5) business days prior to the delivery of and payment for any bonds, there 
shall be filed with the Secretary of State a preliminary copy of the official 
statement, prospectus, or other offering document pertaining to the issuance. 
Prior to the expiration of fifteen (15) business days following the bond 
delivery and payment, there shall be filed with the Secretary of State and the 
Oklahoma Securities Commission a copy, in final form, of the official statement, 
prospectus, or other offering document. If no official statement, prospectus, or 
other offering document is used in connection with the sale of the bonds, in 
lieu thereof there shall be filed a copy of the draft and final proceedings of 
the Authority authorizing the sale and issuance of the bonds.</P>
<P>I. Resolution Constitutes a Contract. The bond resolution, trust indenture, 
or other security agreement pursuant to which any bonds are issued shall 
constitute a contract with the holders of the bonds and may contain provisions 
including but not limited to:</P>
<P>1. The terms and provisions of the bonds;</P>
<P>2. The pledge and grant of a security interest in any personal property and 
in all or any part of the revenue from any project or any revenue-producing 
contract made by the Authority with any person to secure the payment of bonds, 
subject to any agreements with the holders of bonds which might then exist;</P>
<P>3. The custody, collection, securing, investment, and payment of any 
revenues, assets, money, funds, or property with respect to which the Authority 
may have any rights or interest;</P>
<P>4. The rates or charges for electrical energy or other services rendered by 
the Authority, the amount to be raised by the rates or charges, and the use and 
disposition of any or all revenue;</P>
<P>5. The creation of reserves or sinking funds and the regulation and 
disposition thereof;</P>
<P>6. The purposes to which the proceeds from the sale of any bonds then or 
thereafter to be issued may be applied, and the pledge or revenues to secure the 
payment of the bonds;</P>
<P>7. The limitations on the issuance of any additional bonds, the terms upon 
which additional bonds may be issued and secured, and the refunding of 
outstanding bonds;</P>
<P>8. The rank or priority of any bonds with respect to any lien or 
security;</P>
<P>9. The creation of special funds or monies to be held in trust or otherwise 
for operational expenses, payment, or redemption of bonds, reserves, or other 
purposes, and the use and disposition of monies held in the funds;</P>
<P>10. The procedure by which the terms of any contract with or for the benefit 
of the holders of bonds may be amended or revised, the amount of bonds the 
holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which consent may be 
given;</P>
<P>11. The definition of the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a 
default in the duties of the Authority to holders of its bonds, and the rights 
and remedies of the holders in the event of default, including, if the Authority 
so determines, the right to accelerate the due date of the bonds or the right to 
appoint a receiver or receivers of the property or revenues subject to the lien 
of the bond resolution, trust indenture, or other security agreement;</P>
<P>12. Any additional agreements with or for the benefit of the holders of bonds 
or any covenants or restrictions necessary or desirable to safeguard the 
interest of the holders;</P>
<P>13. The custody of its properties or investments, the safekeeping thereof, 
the insurance to be carried thereon, and the use and disposition of insurance 
proceeds;</P>
<P>14. The vesting in a trustee or trustees, within or without this state, of 
such properties, rights, powers, and duties in trust as the Authority may 
determine, or the limiting or abrogating of the rights of the holders of any 
bonds to appoint a trustee, or the limiting of the rights, powers, and duties of 
the trustee; or</P>
<P>15. The appointment of and the establishment of the duties and obligations 
of, any paying agent or other fiduciary within or without this state.</P>
<P>J. Any pledge of revenues, securities, contract rights, or other personal 
property made by the Authority pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma 
Municipal Power Authority Act shall be valid and binding from the date the 
pledge is made. The revenues, securities, contract rights, or other personal 
property so pledged and then held or thereafter received by the Authority or any 
fiduciary shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any 
physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of the pledge shall be 
valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, 
contract, or otherwise against the Authority without regard to whether the 
parties have notice of the lien. The bond resolution, trust indenture, security 
agreement, or other instrument by which a pledge is created need not be filed or 
recorded in any manner.</P>
<P>K. Neither the officials, directors, members of the Authority, or any person 
executing bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds or be subject to any 
personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof. The 
Authority shall have power to indemnify and to purchase and maintain insurance 
on behalf of any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority, in 
connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or 
proceeding.</P>
<P>L. The Authority shall have power to purchase bonds out of any funds 
available therefor, and to hold, pledge, cancel, or retire the bonds and coupons 
prior to maturity, subject to and in accordance with any agreements with the 
holders.</P>
<P>M. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest upon any bonds issued by 
the Authority shall be payable solely from the revenues or funds pledged or 
available for their payment as authorized by the provisions of the Oklahoma 
Municipal Power Authority Act. Each bond shall contain a statement that it 
constitutes an obligation of the Authority, that the principal thereof, premium, 
if any, and interest thereon are payable solely from revenues or funds of the 
Authority and that neither the State of Oklahoma or any political subdivision 
thereof, or any eligible public agency or public trust which has contracted with 
the Authority, is obligated to pay the principal of, premium, if any, or 
interest on the bonds and that neither the faith and credit or the taxing power 
of the State of Oklahoma or any such political subdivision thereof or of any 
such eligible public agency or public trust is pledged to the payment of the 
principal of, premium, if any, or the interest on the bonds.</P></FONT><B><I>
