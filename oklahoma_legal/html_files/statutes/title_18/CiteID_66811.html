<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p>A. An out-of-state savings institution, upon approval by the State Banking Commissioner, may acquire direct or indirect control of an unlimited number of in-state savings associations for operation as in-state savings institutions, and may acquire any such institutions' parent Oklahoma holding company. Any acquisition made pursuant to the provisions of this section may include assets and liabilities of the in-state savings institution or its parent Oklahoma holding company and all branches and facilities thereof.</p>

<p>B. 1. No in-state savings institution which becomes a subsidiary of an out-of-state savings institution under any extraordinary acquisition provisions of federal law, or which is otherwise controlled by an out-of-state savings institution, shall be permitted to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of, or to convert to a branch, any additional in-state savings institution or to establish additional branches or facilities, except as otherwise provided for in this section.</p>

<p>2. No out-of-state savings institution may directly or indirectly acquire control of an in-state savings institution or its parent Oklahoma holding company except as otherwise permitted by this section.</p>

<p>C. No acquisition provided for in this section shall be permitted unless the approval of the Commissioner required pursuant to subsection A of this section:</p>

<p>1. Includes, for all acquisitions, a finding that:</p>

<p>a. the in-state savings institution sought to be acquired or all of the savings institution subsidiaries of the parent Oklahoma holding company sought to be acquired have either been in existence and continuous operation for more than five (5) years, and</p>

<p>b. notice of intent to acquire has been published in a newspaper of general paid circulation in the county or counties where the in-state savings institution to be acquired is located and that a notice of intent to acquire has been mailed by certified mail with return receipt requested to each person owning stock in the in-state savings institution to be acquired or in its parent Oklahoma holding company or, if the in-state savings institution to be acquired is a mutual association, notice has been given as in the case of a proceeding under <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=66799">Section 381.61 </a>of this title;</p>

<p>2. Includes, for any acquisition of a majority of the voting shares of a stock association or of its parent Oklahoma holding company, or for any acquisition of a mutual association by merger or purchase and assumption transaction with another in-state savings association, a finding that the acquisition has been approved by the board of directors and a majority of the stockholders of or holders of voting rights in the in-state savings institution or of its parent Oklahoma holding company, as applicable;</p>

<p>3. Subjects the acquisition to any conditions, restrictions, and requirements that would be applicable to such an acquisition by an in-state savings institution of an out-of-state savings institution in the state where the out-of-state savings institution has its main office, if such state has enacted and implemented legislation authorizing the acquisition by an in-state savings institution of out-of-state savings institutions located in that state, but that would not be applicable to acquisitions in that state by an out-of-state savings institution all of whose savings institution subsidiaries are located in that state; and</p>

<p>4. Except when the additional acquisition is of an in-state savings institution whose stock is held as stock acquired in the course of realizing upon a security interest which secured a debt previously contracted in good faith prior to the original acquisition by the out-of-state savings institution, prohibits additional branching and further acquisitions by an in-state savings institution which is a subsidiary of an out-of-state savings institution unless and until the earlier of:</p>

<p>a. such time as the Commissioner determines that the state in which the out-of-state savings institution has its main office has enacted and implemented legislation authorizing in-state savings institutions to acquire savings institutions in that state on a reciprocal basis, or</p>

<p>b. the expiration of a four-year period commencing on the date of acquisition by the out-of-state savings institution.</p>

<p>D. Any in-state savings institution or its parent Oklahoma holding company which becomes a subsidiary of an out-of-state financial institution under the extraordinary acquisition provisions of federal law, or which is otherwise deemed to be controlled by an out-of-state financial institution, may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any additional in-state financial institution or its parent Oklahoma holding company, establish additional branches or facilities, or convert the existing controlled in-state savings institution to branches of another in-state savings institution:</p>

<p>1. If the Commissioner has determined that the principal place of business of the out-of-state savings institution has enacted and implemented reciprocal acquisition legislation within the purview of this section; or</p>

<p>2. Upon the expiration of a four-year period commencing on the date of acquisition by the out-of-state savings institution.</p>

<p>E. All limitations and restrictions of this act applicable to in-state savings institutions shall apply to an in-state savings institution which becomes a direct or indirect subsidiary of an out-of-state savings institution and to the out-of-state savings institution. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the acquisition by an out-of-state savings institution of all or substantially all of the shares of an in-state savings institution organized solely for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition of a savings institution which has been in existence and continuous operation as a savings institution for more than five (5) years, if the acquisition has otherwise been approved pursuant to this subsection. Nor shall the provisions of this subsection be construed to prohibit an out-of-state savings institution which acquires an in-state savings institution under this section from additional acquisitions under this section, if such acquisition would otherwise be permitted.</p>

<p>F. Any out-of-state savings institution which controls an in-state savings institution shall be subject to the laws of this state and the rules of its agencies relating to the acquisition, ownership, and operation of in-state savings institutions. The Commissioner shall make such rules including the imposition of reasonable application and administration fees as it finds necessary to implement the provisions of this act.</p>

<p>G. The Commissioner may enter into cooperative agreements with other regulatory agencies to facilitate the regulation of savings institutions doing business in this state. If such agreements result in the payment of fees, however calculated, by any other regulatory agency to the Oklahoma State Banking Department for examination activities conducted by Department personnel, whether such examination activity is conducted inside or outside this state, such fees shall be deposited in the Bank Examination Revolving Fund established in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=437228">Section 211.2 of Title 6</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. If such agreements result in the payment of fees, however calculated, by the Department to any other bank supervisory agency for examination activities conducted by such other regulatory agency, whether such examination activity is conducted inside or outside this state, such fees shall be paid by the Department from the Bank Examination Revolving Fund established by Section 211.2 of Title 6 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The Commissioner may accept reports of examinations and other records from such other agencies in lieu of the Commissioner conducting examinations of in-state savings institutions controlled by out-of-state savings institutions. The Commissioner may take any action jointly with other regulatory agencies having concurrent jurisdiction over savings institutions doing business in this state or may take such actions independently in order to carry out its responsibilities.</p>

<p>H. The Commissioner shall have the power to enforce the prohibitions provided for in subsection B of this section by requiring divestiture and through the imposition of fines and penalties, the issuance of cease and desist orders, and such other remedies as are provided by law.</p>

<p>I. Any organization which intentionally and willfully violates any provision of this section, upon conviction, shall be fined not less than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) nor more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each day during which the violation continues. Any individual who intentionally and willfully participates in a violation of any provision of this section, upon conviction, shall be guilty of a Class D3 felony offense and shall be fined not more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), or imprisoned as provided for in subsections B through F of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=538496">Section 20P of Title 21</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, or both such fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>J. Any final order of the Commissioner pursuant to this section shall be appealable pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=76822">Section 207 of Title 6</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>
