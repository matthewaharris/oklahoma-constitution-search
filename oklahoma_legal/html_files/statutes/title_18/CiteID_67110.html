<p align="center">NOTICE TO CLAIMANTS; FILING OF CLAIMS</p>

<p>A. 1. After a corporation has been dissolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, the corporation or any successor entity may give notice of the dissolution requiring all persons having a claim against the corporation other than a claim against the corporation in a pending action, suit, or proceeding to which the corporation is a party to present their claims against the corporation in accordance with the notice. The notice shall state:</p>

<p>a. that all such claims must be presented in writing and must contain sufficient information reasonably to inform the corporation or successor entity of the identity of the claimant and the substance of the claim,</p>

<p>b. the mailing address to which a claim must be sent,</p>

<p>c. the date by which a claim must be received by the corporation or successor entity, which date shall be no earlier than sixty (60) days from the date of the notice,</p>

<p>d. that the claim will be barred if not received by the date referred to in subparagraph c of this paragraph,</p>

<p>e. that the corporation or a successor entity may make distributions to other claimants and the corporation's shareholders or persons interested as having been such without further notice to the claimant, and</p>

<p>f. the aggregate amount, on an annual basis, of all distributions made by the corporation to its shareholders for each of the three (3) years prior to the date the corporation dissolved.</p>

<p>2. The notice shall also be published at least once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the office of the corporation's last registered agent in this state is located and in the corporation's principal place of business and, in the case of a corporation having Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) or more in total assets at the time of its dissolution, at least once in an Oklahoma newspaper having a circulation of at least two hundred fifty thousand (250,000). On or before the date of the first publication of the notice, the corporation or successor entity shall mail a copy of the notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to each known claimant of the corporation, including persons with claims asserted against the corporation in a pending action, suit, or proceeding to which the corporation is a party.</p>

<p>3. Any claim against the corporation required to be presented pursuant to this subsection is barred if a claimant who was given actual notice under this subsection does not present the claim to the dissolved corporation or successor entity by the date referred to in subparagraph c of paragraph 1 of this subsection.</p>

<p>4. A corporation or successor entity may reject, in whole or in part, any claim made by a claimant pursuant to this subsection by mailing notice of rejection by certified or registered mail return receipt requested to the claimant within ninety (90) days after receipt of the claim and, in all events, at least one hundred fifty (150) days before the expiration of the period described in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67108">Section 1099</a> of this title; provided, however, that in the case of a claim filed pursuant to Section 1110 of this title against a corporation or successor entity for which a receiver or trustee has been appointed by the district court, the time period shall be as provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67120">Section 1111</a> of this title, and the thirty-day appeal period provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67120">Section 1111</a> of this title shall be applicable. A notice sent by a corporation or successor entity pursuant to this subsection shall state that any claim rejected will be barred if an action, suit, or proceeding with respect to the claim is not commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date thereof, and shall be accompanied by a copy of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67108">Sections 1099</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67112">1100.3</a> of this title, and, in the case of a notice sent by a court-appointed receiver or trustee for a claim filed pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67119">Section 1110</a> of this title, the notice shall be accompanied by copies of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67119">Sections 1110</a> and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67120">1111</a> of this title.</p>

<p>5. A claim against a corporation is barred if a claimant whose claim is rejected pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subsection does not commence an action, suit, or proceeding with respect to the claim within one hundred twenty (120) days after the mailing of the rejection notice.</p>

<p>B. 1. A corporation or successor entity electing to follow the procedures described in subsection A of this section shall also give notice of the dissolution of the corporation to persons with contractual claims contingent upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events or otherwise conditional or unmatured, and request that those persons present their claims in accordance with the terms of the notice. As used in this section and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67111">Section 1100.2</a> of this title, the term "contractual claims" shall not include any implied warranty as to any product manufactured, sold, distributed, or handled by the dissolved corporation. The notice shall be in substantially the form, and sent and published in the same manner, as described in paragraph 1 of subsection A of this section.</p>

<p>2. The corporation or successor entity shall offer any claimant on a contract whose claim is contingent, conditional, or unmatured, the security that the corporation or successor entity determines is sufficient to provide compensation to the claimant if the claim matures. The corporation or successor entity shall mail the offer to the claimant by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, within ninety (90) days of receipt of the claim and, in all events, at least one hundred fifty (150) days before the expiration of the period described in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=67108">Section 1099</a> of this title. If the claimant offered the security does not deliver in writing to the corporation or successor entity a notice rejecting the offer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the offer for security, the claimant shall be deemed to have accepted the security as the sole source from which to satisfy his or her claim against the corporation.</p>

<p>C. 1. A corporation or successor entity which has given notice in accordance with subsection A of this section shall petition the district court to determine the amount and form of security that will be reasonable likely to be sufficient to provide compensation for any claim against the corporation which is the subject of a pending action, suit, or proceeding to which the corporation is a party other than a claim barred pursuant to subsection A of this section.</p>

<p>2. A corporation or successor entity which has given notice in accordance with subsections A and B of this section shall petition the district court to determine the amount and form of security that will be sufficient to provide compensation to any claimant who has rejected the offer for security made pursuant to paragraph 2 of subsection B of this section.</p>

<p>3. A corporation or successor entity which has given notice in accordance with subsection A of this section shall petition the district court to determine the amount and form of security which will be reasonably likely to be sufficient to provide compensation for claims that have not been made known to the corporation or that have not arisen but that, based on facts known to the corporation or successor entity, are likely to arise or to become known to the corporation or successor entity within five (5) years after the date of dissolution or a longer period of time as the district court may determine not to exceed ten (10) years after the date of dissolution. The district court may appoint a guardian ad litem in respect of any such proceeding brought under this subsection. The reasonable fees and expenses of the guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, shall be paid by the petitioner in the proceeding.</p>

<p>D. The giving of any notice or making of any offer pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not revive any claim then barred or constitute acknowledgment by the corporation or successor entity that any person to whom the notice is sent is a proper claimant and shall not operate as a waiver of any defense or counterclaim in respect of any claim asserted by any person to whom the notice is sent.</p>

<p>E. As used in this section, the term "successor entity" shall include any trust, receivership, or other legal entity governed by the laws of this state to which the remaining assets and liabilities of a dissolved corporation are transferred and which exists solely for the purposes of prosecuting and defending suits, by or against the dissolved corporation, enabling the dissolved corporation to settle and close the business of the dissolved corporation, to dispose of and convey the property of the dissolved corporation, to discharge the liabilities of the dissolved corporation, and to distribute to the dissolved corporation's shareholders any remaining assets, but not for the purpose of continuing the business for which the dissolved corporation was organized.</p>

<p>F. In the case of a nonstock corporation, any notice referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 4 of subsection A of this section shall include a copy of Section 1 of this act. In the case of a nonprofit nonstock corporation, provisions of this section regarding distributions to members shall not apply to the extent that those provisions conflict with any other applicable law or with that corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws.</p>
