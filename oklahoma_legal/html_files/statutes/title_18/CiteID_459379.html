</div>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Applicable to charitable organizations, 
professional fundraisers and professional solicitors, the following shall 
constitute violations of this act:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Knowingly making any false material statement or 
representation on a registration application;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Using the name of a person when soliciting 
contributions or in an advertisement, brochure, stationery or correspondence, 
without the consent or approval of such person, other than an officer, director 
or trustee of the charitable organization by or for which contributions are 
solicited. This paragraph shall not apply to the use of the name of a person 
that has contributed to or sponsored an event or program of the charitable 
organization in a report, brochure, program or listing of donors, contributors, 
sponsors, or supporters issued or published by a charitable organization. This 
paragraph shall not apply to the use of a public figures name and/or likeness 
truthfully and in good faith, so long as such use does not imply a false 
endorsement;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Knowingly using, in connection with solicitation 
of contributions for the purpose of deceiving the public, a name similar to 
other charitable organizations, professional fundraiser, professional solicitor 
or government agency or political subdivision;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Failing to register as required pursuant to 
Sections 552.3, 552.7 or 552.9, as applicable, of Title 18 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes unless otherwise exempted by this act;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Employing in any solicitation or collection of 
contributions for a charitable organization any device, scheme or artifice to 
defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of any false pretense, 
representation or promise; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Failing or refusing to supply requested 
information as required by Section 552.9 of Title 18 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The Attorney General or a district attorney may 
bring an action:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. To obtain a declaratory judgment that an act or 
practice violates this act;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. To enjoin, or to obtain a restraining order 
against a person who has violated or is violating this act;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. To recover actual damages, restitution, 
disgorgement and penalties attributed to a violation of this act;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. To recover reasonable expenses and investigation 
fees attributable to a violation of this act;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. To prosecute any civil or criminal actions as 
provided by this act, as applicable; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. To revoke the registration of a charitable 
organization, professional fundraiser, or professional solicitor for any 
violation of this act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. In lieu of instigating or continuing an action or 
proceeding, the Attorney General or a district attorney may accept a consent 
judgment with respect to any act or practice declared to be a violation of this 
act. Such a consent judgment shall provide for the discontinuance by the person 
entering the same of any act or practice declared to be a violation of this act, 
and it may include a stipulation for the payment by such person of reasonable 
expenses, attorney fees, investigation costs and penalties incurred by the 
Attorney General or a district attorney. The consent judgment also may include a 
stipulation for restitution to be made by such person to contributors of money, 
property or other things received from contributors in connection with a 
violation of this act and also may include a stipulation for specific 
performance. Any consent judgment entered into pursuant to this section shall 
not be deemed to admit the violation, unless it does so by its terms. Before any 
consent judgment entered into pursuant to this section shall be effective, it 
must be approved by the district court and an entry made in the manner required 
for making an entry of judgment. After such approval is received, any breach of 
the conditions of such consent judgment shall be treated as a violation of a 
court order, and shall be subject to all the penalties provided by law 
therefor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. In any action brought by the Attorney General or a 
district attorney, the court may:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Make such orders or judgments as may be necessary 
to prevent the use or employment by a person of any practice declared to be a 
violation of this act;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Make such orders or judgments as may be necessary 
to compensate any person for damages sustained;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Enjoin any person from engaging in solicitation of 
charitable contributions in this state;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Revoke the registration of a charitable 
organization, professional fundraiser or professional solicitor;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Enter any order that is appropriate in a criminal 
prosecution of crimes identified in this act or any other state law; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Grant other appropriate relief.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. When an action is filed under this act by the 
Attorney General or a district attorney, no action seeking an injunction or 
declaratory judgment shall be filed in any other district in this state based 
upon the same transaction or occurrence, series of transactions or occurrences, 
or allegations that form the basis of the first action filed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. When the Attorney General or a district attorney 
has reason to believe that a person has engaged in, is engaging in or is about 
to engage in any practice declared to be in violation of this act and he or she 
believes it to be in the public interest that an investigation should be made to 
ascertain whether a person has in fact engaged in, is engaging in or is about to 
engage in any such practice, he or she may execute in writing and cause to be 
served upon any such person who is believed to have information, documentary 
material or physical evidence relevant to the alleged violation an investigative 
demand requiring such person to furnish, under oath or otherwise, a report in 
writing setting forth the nonprivileged relevant facts and circumstances of 
which the person has knowledge, or to appear and testify, or to produce relevant 
nonprivileged documentary material or physical evidence for examination at such 
reasonable time and place as may be stated in the investigative demand, 
concerning the solicitation of charitable contributions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. To accomplish the objectives and to carry out the 
duties prescribed by this act, the Attorney General or district attorney, in 
addition to other powers conferred on him or her by this act or the laws of this 
state, may issue subpoenas or other process to any person and conduct hearings 
in aid of any investigation or inquiry, administer oaths and take sworn 
statements under penalty of perjury, and serve and execute in any county, search 
warrants; provided, that none of the powers conferred by this act shall be used 
for the purpose of compelling any natural person to furnish testimony or 
evidence that might tend to incriminate him or her or subject him or her to a 
penalty; and provided further, that information obtained pursuant to the powers 
conferred by this act shall not be made public or disclosed by the Attorney 
General, district attorney or their employees unless otherwise provided under 
this act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. In addition to any other penalties provided under 
this act, a charitable organization, professional fundraiser, or professional 
solicitor that is found to be in violation of the Oklahoma Solicitation of 
Charitable Contributions Act in a civil action or who willfully violates the 
terms of any injunction or court order issued pursuant to the Oklahoma 
Solicitation of Charitable Contributions Act shall pay a civil penalty of not 
more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) per violation, taking into account 
the nature and severity of the violation and the benefit provided to the public 
by the violator, along with the need for protecting contributors and donors. For 
the purposes of this section, the district court issuing an injunction shall 
retain jurisdiction, and in such cases, the Attorney General, acting in the name 
of the state, or a district attorney may petition for recovery of civil 
penalties.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. In administering and pursuing actions under this 
act, the Attorney General and a district attorney are authorized to sue for and 
collect reasonable expenses, attorney fees, and investigation fees as determined 
by the court. Civil penalties or contempt penalties sued for and recovered by 
the Attorney General or a district attorney shall be used for the furtherance of 
their duties and activities under this act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. In addition to other penalties imposed by this 
act, any person convicted in a criminal proceeding of committing an act 
prohibited in paragraph 1, 3 or 5 of subsection A of this section, shall be 
guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine not to 
exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or imprisonment in the custody of the 
Department of Corrections for not more than five (5) years, or by both such fine 
and imprisonment.</FONT></P>
