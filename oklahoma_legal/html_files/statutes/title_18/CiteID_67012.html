<p><em><strong>Multiple Amendments Enacted During the 2024 Legislative Session</strong></em></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Version 1 (Amended by Laws 2024, SB 620, c. 120, § 10, eff. November 1, 2024)</strong></p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; CONTENTS</p>

<p>A. The certificate of incorporation shall set forth:</p>

<p>1. The name of the corporation which shall contain one of the words association, company, corporation, club, foundation, fund, incorporated, institute, society, union, syndicate, or limited or abbreviations thereof, with or without punctuation, or words or abbreviations thereof, with or without punctuation, of like import of foreign countries or jurisdictions; provided that such abbreviations are written in Roman characters or letters, and which shall be such as to distinguish it upon the records in the Office of the Secretary of State from:</p>

<p>a. names of other corporations, whether domestic or foreign, then existing or which existed at any time during the preceding three (3) years,</p>

<p>b. names of partnerships whether general or limited, or domestic or foreign, then in good standing or registered or which were in good standing or registered at any time during the preceding three (3) years,</p>

<p>c. names of limited liability companies, whether domestic or foreign, then in good standing or registered or which were in good standing or registered at any time during the preceding three (3) years,</p>

<p>d. trade names or fictitious names filed with the Secretary of State, or</p>

<p>e. corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership names reserved with the Secretary of State;</p>

<p>2. The address including the street, number, city and postal code of the corporations registered office in this state, and the name of the corporations registered agent at such address;</p>

<p>3. The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted. It shall be sufficient to state, either alone or with other businesses or purposes, that the purpose of the corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the general corporation law of this state, and by such statement all lawful acts and activities shall be within the purposes of the corporation, except for express limitations, if any;</p>

<p>4. If the corporation is to be authorized to issue only one class of stock, the total number of shares of stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue and the par value of each of such shares, or a statement that all such shares are to be without par value. If the corporation is to be authorized to issue more than one class of stock, the certificate of incorporation shall set forth the total number of shares of all classes of stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue and the number of shares of each class, and shall specify each class the shares of which are to be without par value and each class the shares of which are to have par value and the par value of the shares of each such class. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to corporations which are not organized for profit and which are not to have authority to issue capital stock. In the case of such corporations, the fact that they are not to have authority to issue capital stock shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to nonstock corporations. In the case of nonstock corporations, the fact that they are not authorized to issue capital stock shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation. The conditions of membership, or other criteria for identifying members, of nonstock corporations shall likewise be stated in the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws. Nonstock corporations shall have members, but the failure to have members shall not affect otherwise valid corporate acts or work a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation. Nonstock corporations may provide for classes or groups of members having relative rights, powers and duties, and may make provision for the future creation of additional classes or groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties senior to existing classes and groups of members. Except as otherwise provided in the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, nonstock corporations may also provide that any member or class or group of members shall have full, limited, or no voting rights or powers, including that any member or class or group of members shall have the right to vote on a specified transaction even if that member or class or group of members does not have the right to vote for the election of members of the governing body of the corporation. Voting by members of a nonstock corporation may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group, or any other basis set forth. The provisions referred to in the three preceding sentences may be set forth in the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws. If neither the certificate of incorporation nor the bylaws of a nonstock corporation state the conditions of membership, or other criteria for identifying members, the members of the corporation shall be deemed to be those entitled to vote for the election of the members of the governing body pursuant to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of such corporation or otherwise until thereafter otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws;</p>

<p>5. The name and mailing address of the incorporator or incorporators;</p>

<p>6. If the powers of the incorporator or incorporators are to terminate upon the filing of the certificate of incorporation, the names and mailing addresses of the persons who are to serve as directors until the first annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualify;</p>

<p>7. If the corporation is not for profit:</p>

<p>a. that the corporation does not afford pecuniary gain, incidentally or otherwise, to its members as such,</p>

<p>b. the name and mailing address of each member of the governing body,</p>

<p>c. the number of members of the governing body to be elected at the first meeting, and</p>

<p>d. in the event the corporation is a church, the street address of the location of the church.</p>

<p>The restriction on affording pecuniary gain to members shall not prevent a not-for-profit corporation operating as a cooperative from rebating excess revenues to patrons who may also be members; and</p>

<p>8. If the corporation is a charitable nonstock and does not otherwise provide in its certificate of incorporation:</p>

<p>a. that the corporation is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, and scientific purposes including, for such purposes, the making of distributions to organizations that qualify as exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the corresponding section of any future federal tax code,</p>

<p>b. that upon the dissolution of the corporation, its assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the corresponding section of any future federal tax code, for a public purpose, and</p>

<p>c. that the corporation complies with the requirements in paragraph 7 of this subsection.</p>

<p>B. In addition to the matters required to be set forth in the certificate of incorporation pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of this section, the certificate of incorporation may also contain any or all of the following matters:</p>

<p>1. Any provision for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and any provision creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the corporation, the directors, and the shareholders, or any class of the shareholders, or the governing body, the members, or any class or group of the members of a nonstock corporation, if such provisions are not contrary to the laws of this state. Any provision which is required or permitted by any provision of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act to be stated in the bylaws may instead be stated in the certificate of incorporation;</p>

<p>2. The following provisions, in substantially the following form:</p>

<p>a. for a corporation, other than a nonstock corporation: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this corporation and its shareholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within this state, on the application in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or shareholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67115">Section 1106</a> of this title or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67109">Section 1100</a> of this title, may order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the shareholders or class of shareholders of this corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths (3/4) in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the shareholders or class of shareholders of this corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement and the reorganization, if sanctioned by the court to which the application has been made, shall be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the shareholders or class of shareholders, of this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this corporation, and</p>

<p>b. for a nonstock corporation:</p>

<p>Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this corporation and its members or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within this state may, on the application in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or member thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of Section 1106 of this title or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of Section 1100 of this title, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the members or class of members of this corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths (3/4) in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the members or class of members of this corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement and the reorganization, if sanctioned by the court to which the application has been made, shall be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the members or class of members, of this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this corporation;</p>

<p>3. Such provisions as may be desired granting to the holders of the stock of the corporation, or the holders of any class or series of a class thereof, the preemptive right to subscribe to any or all additional issues of stock of the corporation of any or all classes or series thereof, or to any securities of the corporation convertible into such stock. No shareholder shall have any preemptive right to subscribe to an additional issue of stock or to any security convertible into such stock unless, and except to the extent that, such right is expressly granted to him in the certificate of incorporation. Preemptive rights, if granted, shall not extend to fractional shares;</p>

<p>4. Provisions requiring, for any corporate action, the vote of a larger portion of the stock or of any class or series thereof, or of any other securities having voting power, or a larger number of the directors, than is required by the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act;</p>

<p>5. A provision limiting the duration of the corporations existence to a specified date; otherwise, the corporation shall have perpetual existence;</p>

<p>6. A provision imposing personal liability for the debts of the corporation on its shareholders to a specified extent and upon specified conditions; otherwise, the shareholders of a corporation shall not be personally liable for the payment of the corporations debts, except as they may be liable by reason of their own conduct or acts; or</p>

<p>7. A provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director or officer to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of:</p>

<p>a. a director or officer for any breach of the directors or officers duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders,</p>

<p>b. a director or officer for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,</p>

<p>c. a director under <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67059">Section 1053</a> of this title,</p>

<p>d. a director or officer for any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit, or</p>

<p>e. an officer in any action by or in the right of the corporation.</p>

<p>No such provision shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer for any act or omission occurring before the date when such provision becomes effective. An amendment, repeal, or elimination of such provision shall not affect its application with respect to an act or omission by a director or officer occurring before the amendment, repeal, or elimination of the provision unless the provision provides otherwise at the time of the act or omission.</p>

<p>Any reference in this subsection to a director shall be deemed to refer to such other persons who, under a provision of the certificate of incorporation in accordance with subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67033">Section 1027</a> of this title, exercises or performs any of the powers or duties otherwise conferred or imposed upon the board of directors under this title.</p>

<p>C. It shall not be necessary to set forth in the certificate of incorporation any of the powers conferred on corporations by the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act.</p>

<p>D. Except for provisions included under paragraphs 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 of subsection A of this section and paragraphs 2, 5 and 7 of subsection B of this section, and provisions included under paragraph 4 of subsection A of this section specifying the classes, number of shares and par value of shares a corporation other than a nonstock corporation is authorized to issue, any provision of the certificate of incorporation may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside the instrument, provided that the manner in which the facts shall operate upon the provision is clearly and explicitly set forth therein. As used in this subsection, the term facts includes but is not limited to the occurrence of any event including a determination or action by any person or body, including the corporation.</p>

<p>1. Any provision for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and any provision creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the corporation, the directors, and the shareholders, or any class of the shareholders, or the governing body, the members, or any class or group of the members of a nonstock corporation, if such provisions are not contrary to the laws of this state. Any provision which is required or permitted by any provision of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act to be stated in the bylaws may instead be stated in the certificate of incorporation;</p>

<p>2. The following provisions, in substantially the following form:</p>

<p>a. for a corporation, other than a nonstock corporation: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this corporation and its shareholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Oklahoma, on the application in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or shareholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67115">Section 1106</a> of this title or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67109">Section 1100</a> of this title, may order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the shareholders or class of shareholders of this corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths (3/4) in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the shareholders or class of shareholders of this corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement and the reorganization, if sanctioned by the court to which the application has been made, shall be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the shareholders or class of shareholders, of this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this corporation, and</p>

<p>b. for a nonstock corporation:</p>

<p>Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this corporation and its members or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Oklahoma may, on the application in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or member thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of Section 1106 of this title or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of Section 1100 of this title, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the members or class of members of this corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths (3/4) in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the members or class of members of this corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement and the reorganization, if sanctioned by the court to which the application has been made, shall be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the members or class of members, of this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this corporation;</p>

<p>3. Such provisions as may be desired granting to the holders of the stock of the corporation, or the holders of any class or series of a class thereof, the preemptive right to subscribe to any or all additional issues of stock of the corporation of any or all classes or series thereof, or to any securities of the corporation convertible into such stock. No shareholder shall have any preemptive right to subscribe to an additional issue of stock or to any security convertible into such stock unless, and except to the extent that, such right is expressly granted to him in the certificate of incorporation. Preemptive rights, if granted, shall not extend to fractional shares;</p>

<p>4. Provisions requiring, for any corporate action, the vote of a larger portion of the stock or of any class or series thereof, or of any other securities having voting power, or a larger number of the directors, than is required by the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act;</p>

<p>5. A provision limiting the duration of the corporations existence to a specified date; otherwise, the corporation shall have perpetual existence;</p>

<p>6. A provision imposing personal liability for the debts of the corporation on its shareholders to a specified extent and upon specified conditions; otherwise, the shareholders of a corporation shall not be personally liable for the payment of the corporations debts, except as they may be liable by reason of their own conduct or acts;</p>

<p>7. A provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director:</p>

<p>a. for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders,</p>

<p>b. for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,</p>

<p>c. under <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67059">Section 1053</a> of this title, or</p>

<p>d. for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.</p>

<p>No such provision shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission occurring before the date when such provision becomes effective.</p>

<p>C. It shall not be necessary to set forth in the certificate of incorporation any of the powers conferred on corporations by the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act.</p>

<p>D. Except for provisions included under paragraphs 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 of subsection A of this section and paragraphs 2, 5 and 7 of subsection B of this section, and provisions included under paragraph 4 of subsection A of this section specifying the classes, number of shares and par value of shares a corporation other than a nonstock corporation is authorized to issue, any provision of the certificate of incorporation may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside the instrument, provided that the manner in which the facts shall operate upon the provision is clearly and explicitly set forth therein. As used in this subsection, the term facts includes, but is not limited to, the occurrence of any event, including a determination or action by any person or body, including the corporation.</p>
