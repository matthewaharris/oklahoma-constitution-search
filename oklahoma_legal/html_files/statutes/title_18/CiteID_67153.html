<p>1. For any report, document, or other paper required to be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State, a fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00);</p>

<p>2. For reservation of corporate name, a fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00);</p>

<p>3. For issuing extra copies of any certificate not requiring any extra filing of papers or documents of any kind, a fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00);</p>

<p>4. For issuing any other certificate, a fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00);</p>

<p>5. For receiving a filing or indexing the annual certificate of a foreign corporation doing business in this state, or both when filed together, a fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00);</p>

<p>10.

If an amendment shall provide for an increase in authorized capital in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), the filing fee shall be an amount equal to one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of such increase;</p>

<p>11. For filing and issuing certificates of consolidation, if the resulting corporation is a domestic corporation, or merger, if the surviving corporation is a domestic corporation, the fee shall be One Hundred Dollars ($100.00); provided, however, not-for-profit corporations shall only be required to pay a fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00).

<p>12. For filing and issuing a certificate of conversion, whenever the resulting corporation is a domestic corporation, the minimum fee shall be One Hundred Dollars ($100.00); provided, however, if the certificate of incorporation of the resulting corporation authorizes capital stock in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), the filing fee shall be an amount equal to one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of such authorized capital. If the resulting domestic corporation is not for profit, it shall only be required to pay a fee of Fifty Dollars ($50.00);</p>

<p>17. Every foreign corporation on the anniversary of its qualification in this state each year, shall cause to be filed with the Secretary of State a certificate of its president, vice-president or other managing officers, in which shall be stated and shown the maximum amount of capital the corporation had invested in the state at any time subsequent to the issuance to it of a certificate to do business in this state and the amount of capital previously paid upon. If the amount of capital so invested as shown by said certificate exceeds the amount formerly paid upon, the corporation, at the time of filing said certificate, shall pay to the Secretary of State an additional fee equal to one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of the amount of such excess capital so invested by the corporation in the state; provided, that no such corporation shall be required to pay a filing fee on an amount in excess of its authorized capital, or to file the certificate provided for in this paragraph after it shall have paid a filing fee on its total authorized capitalization;</p>

<p>18. For acting as the registered agent, a fee of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) payable on the first day of July each year, and if not paid before the next ensuing September 1st, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall suspend and forfeit the charter of the delinquent corporation pursuant to the procedures prescribed in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92304">Section 1212 of Title 68</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. The Tax Commission shall collect and audit the registered agent fee authorized pursuant to this paragraph in conjunction with the collection and audit of franchise taxes as provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92293">Sections 1201</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92306">1214 of Title 68</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. All monies received by the Tax Commission pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Revenue Fund;</p>

<p>19. For filing a change of address for any individual, corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership designated by a corporation as its registered agent for service of process, or for the change of name or the resignation of a registered agent, a fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00), for the first forty corporations and Five Dollars ($5.00) for each additional corporation within any bulk filing;</p>

<p>20. For any response by means of telecommunications to inquiries regarding information required to be maintained by the Secretary of State, a fee of Five Dollars ($5.00), unless otherwise provided. Fees collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in the Revolving Fund for the Office of the Secretary of State; and</p>

<p>21. For receiving a filing of an international corporation agent, a fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00).</p>

<p>B. Except as otherwise provided by law, fees paid to the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act shall be properly accounted for and shall be paid monthly to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>C. For any certificate supplied by the county clerk, such clerk shall receive a fee of One Dollar ($1.00). Such fees shall be properly accounted for and shall be paid into the county treasury in the same manner as other fees collected by the county clerk for the filing and recording of mortgages and deeds.</p>

<p>D. In any court proceeding pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act requiring the filing of any decree, order, report or other document in the Office of the Secretary of State or in the office of any county clerk, in addition to the usual court costs and the costs for filing in the office of the clerk of the court, fees equal to the amounts provided for in this section for such required filing shall be collected as costs in such proceedings and such amount shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State and the county clerk with the papers to be filed.</p>

<p>E. The provisions contained in this section relating to the payment of incorporation fees by foreign corporations are not intended and shall not be construed to relieve such corporations, where applicable, of the payment of the annual corporate franchise tax to the Tax Commission.</p>

<p>F. For the purposes of computing the fees to be collected by the Secretary of State pursuant to the provisions of this section, each share without par value shall be treated the same as a share with a par value of Fifty Dollars ($50.00), and the fees thereon shall be collected accordingly.</p>

<p>G. Payments for any required fees except as otherwise provided by law may be made as follows:</p>

<p>1. By the applicant's personal or company check, cash, or money order; or</p>

<p>2. By a nationally recognized credit card issued to the applicant. The Secretary of State may add a convenience fee, not to exceed four percent (4%) of the amount of such payment for services provided through telephonic or electronic media. For purposes of this paragraph, "nationally recognized credit card" means any instrument or device, whether known as a credit card, credit plate, charge plate, or by any other name, issued with or without fee by an issuer for the use of the cardholder in obtaining goods, services, or anything else of value on credit which is accepted by over one thousand merchants in this state. The Secretary of State shall determine which nationally recognized credit cards will be accepted; provided, however, the Secretary of State must ensure that no loss of state revenue will occur by the use of such card. The convenience fee collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be credited to the Revolving Fund for the Office of the Secretary of State, as established in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=88200">Section 276.1 of Title 62</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes.</p>
