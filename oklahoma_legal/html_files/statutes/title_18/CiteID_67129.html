</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">REVIVAL OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION</p>

<p>A. As used in this section, certificate of incorporation includes the charter of a corporation organized pursuant to the provisions of any law of this state.</p>

<p>B. Any corporation whose certificate of incorporation has become forfeited by law for nonpayment of taxes may at any time procure a revival of its certificate of incorporation, together with all the rights, franchises, privileges and immunities and subject to all of its duties, debts and liabilities which had been secured or imposed by its original certificate of incorporation and all amendments thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section shall not be applicable to a corporation whose certificate of incorporation has been revoked or forfeited pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67113">Section 1104</a> of this title.</p>

<p>C. The revival of the certificate of incorporation may be procured as authorized by the board of directors or members of the governing body of the corporation in accordance with subsection H and by executing, acknowledging and filing a certificate of revival in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67013">Section 1007</a> of this title.</p>

<p>D. The certificate required by the provisions of subsection C of this section shall state:</p>

<p>1. The date of filing of the corporations original certificate of incorporation; the name under which the corporation was originally incorporated; the name of the corporation at the time its certificate of incorporation became forfeited or void pursuant to this title; and the new name under which the corporation is to be revived to the extent required by subsection F of this section;</p>

<p>2. The address of the corporations registered office in this state, which shall be stated in accordance with subsection C of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67027">Section 1021</a> of this title, and the name of its registered agent at such address;</p>

<p>3. That the corporation desiring to be revived and so reviving its certificate of incorporation was organized pursuant to the laws of this state;</p>

<p>4. The date when the certificate of incorporation became forfeited or that the validity of any revival has been brought into question; and</p>

<p>5. That the certificate of revival is filed by authority of the board of directors or members of the governing body of the corporation as provided for in subsection H of this section.</p>

<p>E. Upon the filing of the certificate in accordance with the provisions of Section 1007 of this title, the corporation shall be revived with the same force and effect as if its certificate of incorporation had not become forfeited. Such revival shall validate all contracts, acts, matters and things made, done and performed within the scope of its certificate of incorporation by the corporation, its directors or members of its governing body, officers, agents and shareholders or members during the time when its certificate of incorporation was forfeited, with the same force and effect and to all intents and purposes as if the certificate of incorporation had at all times remained in full force and effect. All real and personal property, rights and credits, which belonged to the corporation at the time its certificate of incorporation became forfeited and which were not disposed of prior to the time of its revival and all real and personal property, rights and credits acquired by the corporation after its certificate of incorporation became forfeited pursuant to this title shall be vested in the corporation, after its revival, as if its certificate of incorporation had at all times remained in full force and effect, and the corporation after its revival shall be as exclusively liable for all contracts, acts, matters and things made, done or performed in its name and on its behalf by its directors or members of its governing body, officers, agents and shareholders or members prior to its revival, as if its certificate of incorporation had at all times remained in full force and effect.</p>

<p>F. If, after three (3) years from the date upon which the certificate of incorporation became forfeited for nonpayment of taxes, the name of the corporation is unavailable upon the records of the Secretary of State, then in such case the corporation to be revived shall not be revived under the same name which it bore when its certificate of incorporation became forfeited, or expired but shall be revived under some other name as set forth in the certificate to be filed pursuant to subsection C of this section.</p>

<p>G. Any corporation that revives its certificate of incorporation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall pay to this state the amounts provided in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92293">Sections 1201</a> through <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=92306">1214 of Title 68</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes. No payment made pursuant to this subsection shall reduce the amount of franchise tax due pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1201 through 1214 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes for the year in which the revival is effected.</p>

<p>H. For purposes of this section, the board of directors or governing body of the corporation shall be comprised of the persons, who, but for the certificate of incorporation having become forfeited pursuant to this title, would be the duly elected or appointed directors or members of the governing body of the corporation. The requirement for authorization by the board of directors under subsection C of this section shall be satisfied if a majority of the directors or members of the governing body then in office, even though less than a quorum, or the sole director or member of the governing body then in office, authorizes the revival of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation and the filing of the certificate required by subsection C of this section. In any case where there shall be no directors of the corporation available to revive the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, the shareholders may elect a full board of directors, as provided by the bylaws of the corporation, and the board so elected may then authorize the revival of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation and the filing of the certificate required by subsection C of this section. A special meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of electing directors may be called by any officer or shareholder upon notice given in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67073">Section 1067</a> of this title. For purposes of this section, the bylaws shall be the bylaws of the corporation that, but for the certificate of incorporation having become forfeited, would be the duly adopted bylaws of the corporation.</p>

<p>I. After a revival of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation shall have been effected, the provisions of subsection C of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67062">Section 1056</a> of this title shall govern and the period of time during which the certificate of incorporation of the corporation was forfeited shall be included within the calculation of the thirty-day and thirteen-month periods to which subsection C of Section 1056 of this title refers. A special meeting of shareholders held in accordance with subsection H of this section shall be deemed an annual meeting of shareholders for purposes of subsection C of Section 1056 of this title.</p>

<p>J. Whenever it shall be desired to revive the certificate of incorporation of any nonstock corporation, the governing body shall perform all the acts necessary for the revival of the charter of the corporation which are performed by the board of directors in the case of a corporation having capital stock. In addition, the members of any nonstock corporation who are entitled to vote for the election of members of its governing body and any other members entitled to vote for dissolution under the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of such corporation, shall perform all the acts necessary for the revival of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation which are performed by the shareholders in the case of a corporation having capital stock. In all other respects, the procedure for the revival of the certificate of incorporation of a nonstock corporation shall conform, as nearly as may be applicable, to the procedure prescribed in this section for the revival of the certificate of incorporation of a corporation having capital stock; provided, however, subsection I of this section shall not apply to nonstock corporations.</p>
