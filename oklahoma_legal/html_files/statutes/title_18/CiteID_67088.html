<p style="text-align: center;">MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS; SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON SURVIVING OR RESULTING CORPORATION</p>

<p>A.  Any one or more domestic corporations may merge or consolidate with one or more foreign corporations, unless the laws of the jurisdiction or jurisdictions under which such foreign corporation or corporations are organized prohibit the merger or consolidation.  The constituent corporations may merge into a single surviving corporation, which may be any one of the constituent corporations, or they may consolidate into a new resulting corporation formed by the consolidation, which may be a corporation of the jurisdiction of organization of any one of the constituent corporations, pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, as the case may be, complying and approved in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>

<p>B.  All the constituent corporations shall enter into an agreement of merger or consolidation.  The agreement shall state:</p>

<p>1.  The terms and conditions of the merger or consolidation;</p>

<p>2.  The mode of carrying the same into effect;</p>

<p>3.  In the case of a merger in which the surviving corporation is a domestic corporation, such amendments or changes in the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation as are desired to be effected by the merger, which amendments or changes may amend and restate the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation in its entirety, or, if no such amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of incorporation;</p>

<p>4.  In the case of a consolidation in which the resulting corporation is a domestic corporation, that the certificate of incorporation of the resulting corporation shall be as is set forth in an attachment to the agreement;</p>

<p>5.  The manner, if any, of converting the shares of each of the constituent corporations into shares or other securities of the corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation, or of canceling some or all of the shares, and, if any shares of any of the constituent corporations are not to remain outstanding, to be converted solely into shares or other securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or to be canceled, the cash, property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity which the holder of the shares is to receive in exchange for, or upon conversion of, the shares and the surrender of any certificates evidencing them, which cash, property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity may be in addition to or in lieu of the shares or other securities of the surviving or resulting corporation;</p>

<p>6.  Other details or provisions as are deemed desirable including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a provision for the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance or recognition of fractional shares, rights or other securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or of any other corporation or entity, the shares, rights or other securities of which are to be received in the merger or consolidation, or for some other arrangement with respect thereto consistent with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67042">Section 1036</a> of this title; and</p>

<p>7.  Other provisions or facts as shall be required to be set forth in an agreement of merger or consolidation including any provision for amendment of the certificate of incorporation or equivalent document of a surviving or resulting corporation and that can be stated in the case of a merger or consolidation.  Any of the terms of the agreement of merger or consolidation may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside of the agreement; provided, that the manner in which the facts shall operate upon the terms of the agreement is clearly and expressly set forth in the agreement of merger or consolidation.  The term facts as used in this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, the occurrence of any event including a determination or action by any person or body including the corporation.</p>

<p>C.  The agreement shall be adopted, approved, executed, and acknowledged by each of the constituent corporations in accordance with the laws under which it is organized, and, in the case of a domestic corporation, in the same manner as is provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67087">Section 1081</a> of this title.  The agreement shall be filed and shall become effective for all purposes of the laws of this state when and as provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67087">Section 1081</a> of this title with respect to the merger or consolidation of domestic corporations.  In lieu of filing the agreement of merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation may file a certificate of merger or consolidation executed in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67013">Section 1007</a> of this title, which states:</p>

<p>1.  The name and jurisdiction of organization of each of the constituent corporations;</p>

<p>2.  That an agreement of merger or consolidation has been approved, adopted, executed and acknowledged by each of the constituent corporations in accordance with the provisions of this subsection;</p>

<p>3.  The name of the surviving or resulting corporation;</p>

<p>4.  In the case of a merger in which the surviving corporation is a domestic corporation, the amendments or changes in the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation, which may be amended and restated, that are effected by the merger, which amendments or changes may amend and restate the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation in its entirety, or, if no amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of incorporation;</p>

<p>5.  In the case of a consolidation in which the resulting corporation is a domestic corporation, that the certificate of incorporation of the resulting corporation shall be as is set forth in an attachment to the certificate;</p>

<p>6.  That the executed agreement of consolidation or merger is on file at the principal place of business of the surviving or resulting corporation, and the address thereof;</p>

<p>7.  That a copy of the agreement of consolidation or merger will be furnished by the surviving or resulting corporation, on request and without cost, to any shareholder of any constituent corporation;</p>

<p>8.  If the corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation is a domestic corporation, the authorized capital stock of each constituent corporation which is not a domestic corporation; and</p>

<p>9.  The agreement, if any, required by the provisions of subsection D of this section.  For purposes of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67091">Section 1085</a> of this title, the term shareholder in subsection D of this section shall be deemed to include member.</p>

<p>D.  If the corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation is a foreign corporation, it shall agree that it may be served with process in this state in any proceeding for enforcement of any obligation of any constituent corporation of this state, as well as for enforcement of any obligation of the surviving or resulting corporation arising from the merger or consolidation, including any suit or other proceeding to enforce the right of any shareholders as determined in appraisal proceedings pursuant to the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67100">Section 1091</a> of this title, and shall irrevocably appoint the Secretary of State as its agent to accept service of process in any suit or other proceedings and shall specify the address to which a copy of process shall be mailed by the Secretary of State.  In the event of service upon the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=94862">Section 2004 of Title 12</a> of the Oklahoma Statutes, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify the surviving or resulting corporation thereof by letter, certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to the surviving or resulting corporation at the address specified unless the surviving or resulting corporation shall have designated in writing to the Secretary of State a different address for this purpose, in which case it shall be mailed to the last address so designated.  The notice shall include a copy of the process and any other papers served on the Secretary of State pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.  It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to notify the Secretary of State that service is being effected pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, and to pay the Secretary of State the fee provided for in paragraph 7 of subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67153">Section 1142</a> of this title, which fee shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding.  The Secretary of State shall maintain an alphabetical record of any such service setting forth the name of the plaintiff and the defendant, the title, docket number and nature of the proceeding in which process has been served upon the Secretary of State, the fact that service has been effected pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the return date thereof, and the date service was made.  The Secretary of State shall not be required to retain such information longer than five (5) years from receipt of the service of process by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>E.  The provisions of subsection D of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67087">Section 1081</a> of this title shall apply to any merger or consolidation pursuant to the provisions of this section.  The provisions of subsection E of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67087">Section 1081</a> of this title shall apply to a merger pursuant to the provisions of this section in which the surviving corporation is a domestic corporation.  The provisions of subsections F and H of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67087">Section 1081</a> of this title shall apply to any merger pursuant to the provisions of this section.</p>
