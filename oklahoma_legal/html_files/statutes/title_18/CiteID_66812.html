<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Except as otherwise provided in this act, the 
State Banking Commissioner may take possession of a state-chartered savings and 
loan association, if the Commissioner determines that: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. The business of the association is being conducted 
in an unlawful or unsound manner; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The association does not have funds available to 
pay all withdrawals of savings deposits when due or is otherwise unable to 
continue normal operations; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The examination of the association has been 
obstructed or impeded; or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The association is operating in violation of 
provisions of this act despite written notice to discontinue such violation. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. 1. The Commissioner may take possession of any 
state-chartered savings association by posting upon the premises of such 
association a notice reciting that possession is being assumed pursuant to the 
provisions of this section and stating when possession shall be deemed 
effective. Possession may become effective no earlier than the posting of the 
notice. A copy of the notice shall be filed in the district court of the county 
where the association is located. The Commissioner shall notify, if applicable, 
the appropriate district offices of the Director of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of taking possession 
of the association. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. a. Once possession is effective the Commissioner 
shall be vested with the full and exclusive power of management and control, 
including the power to: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) continue or discontinue the business of the 
association, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) stop or limit the payment of the obligations of 
the association, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) employ any necessary assistants, including legal 
counsel, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) execute any instrument in the name of the 
association as Commissioner in charge of liquidation,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(5) commence, defend or conduct in the name of the 
association any action or proceeding to which it may be a party, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(6) enforce the liabilities of stockholders, officers 
and directors of the association, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(7) terminate possession by restoring the assets of 
the association to its board of directors, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(8) reorganize or liquidate the association in 
accordance with this act. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. As soon as practicable after taking possession the 
Commissioner shall make an inventory of the assets of the association and file a 
copy thereof with the district court where the notice of possession was filed. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. While the Commissioner is in possession there 
shall be a postponement of six (6) months after the effective date of 
possession, of the date upon which any period of limitation fixed by statute or 
agreement would otherwise expire on a claim or right of action of the 
association, or upon which a review must be taken or a pleading or other 
document must be filed by the association in any pending action or proceeding. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. a. The Commissioner, within two (2) days after 
taking possession of a stock association, shall call a special meeting of the 
stockholders to allow the stockholders to retain the incumbent board of 
directors or to elect a newly constituted board of directors, who may represent 
the stockholders in the liquidation proceedings and observe, assist and protect 
the interests of the stockholders. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. The board of directors of the association is 
authorized to bring all necessary legal actions for and on behalf of the 
stockholders and to pay attorney's fees in a reasonable amount, if such action 
benefits the liquidating account of the failed association. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. The board of directors, as authorized by the 
stockholders, shall represent the stockholders in the district court in which 
the notice of possession was filed by the Commissioner, as to all matters 
affecting the association. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The association shall continue to exist as a body 
corporate for all purposes, except for the purpose of continuing the business 
for which the association was organized, and may function to assist the 
Commissioner or to protect the stockholders' interests in the assets of the 
liquidating account. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. If the 
Commissioner determines that an emergency exists which may result in serious 
losses to the depositors of an association, he may take possession of the 
association without a prior hearing. Within ten (10) days after the Commissioner 
has taken possession any interested person may appeal such action pursuant to 
the provisions of Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76822"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>207</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of Title 6 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. If the Commissioner determines that liquidation of 
the association is warranted, notice of such determination shall be given to 
such directors, stockholders, depositors and creditors of the association as the 
Commissioner may prescribe. The notice shall be by restricted delivery to the 
directors and stockholders at their last-known address as shown on the records 
of the association, and notice to the depositors and creditors shall be 
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the main 
office of such association is located. Any objection to such determination by a 
person directly affected thereby shall be appealed pursuant to the provisions of 
Section </FONT><A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76822"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>207</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> of Title 6 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes. Unless within ten (10) days after the date of publication an order is 
issued staying the liquidation or unless the Commissioner tenders to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation the appointment as liquidator pursuant to Section 
</FONT><A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=66815"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>381.77</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of this title, the 
Commissioner shall liquidate the association after providing a bond executed by 
a surety company authorized to do business in this state, for the benefit of the 
people of this state, for the faithful discharge of the duties of the 
Commissioner in connection with such liquidation and the accounting for all 
monies coming into the possession of the Commissioner. The cost of such bond 
shall be paid from the assets of the association. Suit may be maintained on such 
bond by any person injured by a breach of the conditions thereof.</FONT><FONT 
face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. After the Commissioner takes possession of an 
association pursuant to the provisions of this section, the stockholders thereof 
may repair its credit, restore or substitute its reserves, and otherwise improve 
its condition so that it is qualified to do a general savings and loan business 
as provided for by law. Such association shall not reopen its business until the 
Commissioner issues written permission therefor after an investigation of the 
affairs of the association and a determination that the board of directors of 
the association has complied with all applicable laws, that the association's 
credit and funds are in all respects repaired, and its reserves restored or 
sufficiently substituted, and that it again should be permitted to reopen for 
business. Written permission to reopen to do a general savings and loan business 
shall be issued in the same manner as is provided by law for granting permission 
to do business after incorporation. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. If the Commissioner determines that reorganization 
of the association is warranted or if the Supreme Court, after staying the 
liquidation of the association, orders such reorganization, the Commissioner, 
after according a hearing to all interested persons, shall enter an order 
proposing a reorganization plan. A copy of the plan shall be sent to each 
depositor and creditor who will not receive full payment of their claim under 
the plan, together with notice that, unless the plan is disapproved, within 
fifteen (15) days after the date of the mailing of the plan, in writing by 
persons holding one-third (1/3) or more of the aggregate amount of such claims, 
the Commissioner shall proceed to effect the reorganization. A department, 
agency, or political subdivision of this state holding a claim which will not be 
paid in full is authorized to participate in the reorganization as any other 
creditor. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. a. Notwithstanding any other provision to the 
contrary, the Commissioner, upon taking possession of an association, may 
immediately liquidate said association without giving prior notice to the 
directors, stockholders, depositors and creditors of such association, if it is 
determined by order of the district court where notice of possession was filed 
that the immediate liquidation of the association is necessary to protect the 
interests of the depositors of the association and is otherwise in the public 
interest. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. In proceeding with the immediate liquidation of 
the association, the Commissioner, in order to facilitate the assumption of the 
deposit liabilities of the closed insured association by another association, 
may borrow monies from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and pledge some 
or all of the assets of the closed insured association as security for such 
borrowing or may sell some or all of the assets of the closed insured 
association to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Once the Commissioner takes possession of an 
association for purposes of liquidation, neither the ten-day periods provided by 
subsection C of this section nor the pendency of any proceeding for review of 
the action of the Commissioner shall operate to defer, delay, impede or prevent 
the payment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of the insured deposits 
of an insured association. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. The Commissioner shall make available to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation such facilities in or of an insured 
association and such books, records and other relevant data of the insured 
association as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation to pay the insured deposits in the insured association as 
provided in this subsection. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its 
directors, officers, agents, and employees, and the Commissioner, and the agents 
and employees of the Commissioner, shall be free from any liability to the 
insured association, its directors, stockholders, and creditors, for any action 
relating to the payment of insured deposits. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. No judgment, lien, or attachment shall be executed 
upon any asset of the association while it is in the possession of the 
Commissioner. The Commissioner, in connection with a liquidation or 
reorganization may: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Vacate and void any lien or attachment, other than 
an attorney's or mechanic's lien, obtained upon any asset of the association 
during the Commissioner's possession or within four (4) months prior to 
commencement thereof, except liens created by the Commissioner while in 
possession; and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Void any transfer of an asset of the association 
made after or in contemplation of its insolvency with intent to effect a 
preference. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The Commissioner may borrow money in the name of 
the association and may pledge its assets as security for a loan. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. All necessary and reasonable expenses of the 
Commissioner relating to the possession of an association and of its 
reorganization or liquidation shall be defrayed from the assets of the 
association. Compensation to liquidating agents and employees shall not be in 
excess of amounts which such individuals would be entitled to in their regular 
employment or for like services rendered within the area of the insolvent 
association, and in no event shall a liquidating agent be paid a monthly salary 
or wage from the assets of the association in excess of the amount of the 
monthly salary of the highest paid official of the insolvent association. Any 
attorney's fee allowed to an attorney representing the liquidating agent shall 
not exceed the reasonable amount charged by other attorneys of similar 
competence for like services in regular employment of an attorney in the area of 
the association. </FONT></P><B><I>
