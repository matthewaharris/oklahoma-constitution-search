</div>
<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. In liquidating an association, the State Banking 
Commissioner may exercise any power of such association, but shall not, without 
the approval of the district court where notice of possession was filed: 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Sell any asset of the association having a value 
in excess of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or such larger sum as may be 
determined by the court, but not exceeding One Hundred Thousand Dollars 
($100,000.00); </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Compromise or release any claim exceeding Five 
Hundred Dollars ($500.00), exclusive of interest or such larger sum as may be 
determined by the court, but not exceeding One Hundred Thousand Dollars 
($100,000.00); or </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Make any payment on any claim, other than a claim 
upon an obligation incurred by the Commissioner, before preparing and filing a 
schedule of determinations in accordance with subsection H of this section. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. 1. The Commissioner may lease for oil and/or gas 
purposes any land vested in the Commissioner as assets of an insolvent 
association. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. In making or executing any such lease the 
Commissioner shall retain and reserve a royalty of not less than one-eighth 
(1/8) of the oil and/or gas produced from said land. Said lease shall be made in 
the same manner as provided for by law for the sale of other assets of 
state-chartered associations in the possession of the Commissioner. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Within six (6) months after the commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the Commissioner may terminate any executory contract, 
including but not limited to contracts for services or advertising, to which the 
association is a party or any obligation of the association as a lessee. A 
lessor who receives at least sixty (60) days' notice of the Commissioner's 
decision to terminate the lease shall not be entitled to a claim for rent other 
than rent accrued to the date of termination nor for damages for such 
termination, except that on building or association premises the lessor may 
receive damages not exceeding one (1) year's rent as provided in such lease. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. As soon after the commencement of liquidation as 
is practicable, the Commissioner shall take the necessary steps to terminate all 
fiduciary positions held by the association and take such action as may be 
necessary to surrender all property held by the association as a fiduciary and 
to settle its fiduciary accounts. The Commissioner may transfer such fiduciary 
accounts to another qualified corporate fiduciary in the same community without 
assent of the parties. Notice of such transfer shall be given by registered mail 
to the parties, and the manner of succession of trust powers and successor 
trustees shall be in accordance with the procedure provided in Section </FONT><A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=76955"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>1018</FONT></A><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial> of Title 6 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes.</FONT><FONT face=Arial> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. The right of any agency of the United States 
insuring deposits to be subrogated to the rights of depositors upon payment of 
their claims shall not be less extensive than what the law of the United States 
requires as a condition of the authority to issue such insurance or make such 
payments to depositors of federal associations. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. Within ten (10) days after taking possession, the 
Commissioner shall send notice of the liquidation to each known depositor, 
creditor, lessee of a safe deposit box, and bailor of property held by the 
association, at the address shown on the books of the association. The notice 
shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in 
which the main office of the association is located once a week for three (3) 
successive weeks. The Commissioner shall send with each notice a statement of 
the amount shown on the books of the association to be the claim of the 
depositor or creditor, with all setoffs and any amounts due to the association. 
The notice shall demand that property held by the association as bailee or in a 
safe deposit box be withdrawn by the person entitled thereto and, if the amount 
claimed differs from that stated in the statement to be due, that the depositor 
or creditor file a claim with the Commissioner within sixty (60) days from the 
date of the first publication of the notice of the liquidation given by the 
Commissioner, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the notice. The 
failure of any depositor, creditor or claimant to receive a notice, or observe 
the published notice of the liquidation by the Commissioner, shall not relieve 
such claimant of the obligation to file a claim, if the amount thereof differs 
from the amount found by the Commissioner. If no claim is filed by the claimant 
within the time specified, then the determination of the Commissioner shall be 
final and shall constitute the claim of that claimant. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. Safe deposit boxes, the contents of which have not 
been removed within sixty (60) days from the date of first publication of the 
notice of liquidation, shall be opened by the Commissioner. Sealed packages 
containing the contents of such box, with a certificate of inventory of 
contents, together with any unclaimed property held by the association as bailee 
and certified inventories thereof, shall be held by the Commissioner and 
administered in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Unclaimed Property 
Act. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. The Commissioner shall: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Notify each person whose claim has not been 
allowed in full, by mailing to the last-known address of such person, as shown 
on the records of the association, a notice of the time when and the place where 
the schedule of determinations will be available for inspection and the date 
when the Commissioner shall file the schedule in court; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. As soon as practical and within one hundred twenty 
(120) days from the date of first publication of the notice of liquidation, 
determine the amount, if any, owing to each known creditor or depositor and the 
priority class of such claim under subsection K of this section, and file such 
determination in the district court where notice of possession was filed; and 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. As soon as practical and within sixty (60) days 
from the date of filing, reject any claim if the Commissioner doubts the 
validity thereof. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. Within twenty (20) days after the filing of the 
schedule of determinations, any creditor, depositor or stockholder may file an 
objection to any determination which adversely affects such creditor, depositor 
or stockholder. Objections so filed shall be heard and determined by the court. 
The clerk of such district court shall enter the objection upon the court docket 
under the case number assigned to the liquidation proceedings. The Commissioner 
and interested claimants as the court determines shall be notified of such 
objection not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing on such objection. 
The matter shall be tried de novo. No person having a claim against an insolvent 
association shall maintain action thereon except as herein provided. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. After filing the schedule of determinations and 
establishing proper reserves for the payment of costs, expenses of liquidation 
and disputed claims, the Commissioner shall pay to any agency of the United 
States insuring deposits in the insolvent association such sum as may be then 
available but not exceeding the amount paid out by such agency as such an 
insurer of deposits and accounts. The Commissioner from time to time may also 
make partial distribution to the holders of claims which are undisputed or which 
have been allowed by the district court, in the order of their priority as 
provided in subsection K of this section. The district court supervising the 
liquidation, as soon as practicable after the establishment of an adequate and 
proper reserve for payment of disputed claims, costs and expenses of 
liquidation, shall direct the Commissioner to make a substantial partial pro 
rata distribution that will not interfere with orderly liquidation, to the 
holders of undisputed claims and those allowed by the court in the order of 
their priority, to the extent that there remains only the determination and 
settlement of disputed claims and the procedures of the final accounting and 
final distribution to be made by the Commissioner as provided in this section. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. 1. The following claims shall have priority in the 
order specified: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. obligations incurred by the Commissioner, fees and 
assessments due to the Oklahoma State Banking Department, and all expenses of 
liquidation, all of which may be covered by a proper reserve of funds, 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. approved claims of depositors against the general 
liquidating account of the association, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. approved claims of general creditors against the 
general liquidating account of the association, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. claims otherwise proper which were not filed 
within the time prescribed by subsection F of this section, and </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. claims of stockholders of the association. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. No claim shall be entitled to interest thereon if 
it is paid within six (6) months after the first publication of notice of the 
liquidation by the Commissioner. If the claim is paid after such period, then 
the unpaid balance of the claim shall be credited with interest at the rate of 
six percent (6%) per annum for the expiration of the six (6) months until paid 
or finally canceled by exhaustion of all assets. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. All distribution declared in accordance with 
subsection J of this section, which shall not be claimed within one (1) year, 
shall be canceled upon the order of the district court having jurisdiction of 
the liquidation of such insolvent association, and the proceeds thereof returned 
to the general liquidating account of the insolvent association. Provided, that 
notice of the application of the Commissioner to the district court for 
permission to cancel such unclaimed distributions shall be given by publication 
for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county 
where the main office of the insolvent association is located. The notice shall 
describe the unclaimed distributions sought to be canceled, giving the name and 
location of the insolvent association, the name of the payee and the amount and 
shall recite the Commissioner has filed an application in the designated 
district court for cancellation of such distributions and shall refer to the 
application for further particulars. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Any assets remaining after all partial 
distributions, after all claims have been paid, or ample provisions for reserves 
are made for payment thereof by the court, shall be distributed to the 
stockholders in accordance with their respective interests. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>L. Unclaimed funds, other than unclaimed 
distributions, remaining after completion of the liquidation shall be retained 
by the Commissioner and administered in accordance with the Uniform Unclaimed 
Property Act. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>M. 1. During the liquidation procedure, the 
Commissioner and the agents and employees of the Commissioner shall prepare an 
annual report that details all receipts and disbursements made from assets in 
the possession of the Commissioner. A copy of the annual report shall be filed 
with the district court of the county where the notice of taking possession was 
filed and a hearing shall be held thereon. Interested parties and the board of 
directors of the insolvent association shall be given such notice of the hearing 
as the court directs and shall make such objections as they shall desire to the 
account. The failure to object at a hearing shall not prejudice the right of any 
claimant or interested party to object to items of expense and proceedings in 
the liquidation upon the final account. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. When the assets have been distributed in 
accordance with this section, except unclaimed funds and contents of safe 
deposit boxes held by the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall file a final 
account with the court. Notice of hearing upon the final account shall be given, 
of not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date 
of the hearing, by registered or certified mail, to all interested persons and 
to the board of directors of the insolvent association and the notice shall be 
published for two (2) successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation 
published in the county where the association is located, showing the nature of 
the hearing, the date and time of the hearing and that such account is for final 
settlement of the liquidating account of such insolvent association. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. The final account shall reflect all the acts of 
the Commissioner as supported by annual reports and such necessary items to 
support the account, including distribution of such remaining cash to the 
stockholders in accordance with their interests and all other assets to the 
board of directors of the association as liquidating agents for the stockholders 
under the Oklahoma General Corporation Act. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The court shall hear all matters relating to the 
final account; allow, reduce or reject any item of expense; and determine all 
matters before it. Any person aggrieved by the judgment of the court may appeal 
as in any other civil action. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Upon approval of the final account by the court, 
the Commissioner shall be relieved of liability in connection with the 
liquidation and shall cancel the charter upon the records of the Department.
