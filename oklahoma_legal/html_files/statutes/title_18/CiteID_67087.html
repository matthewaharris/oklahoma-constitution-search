</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF DOMESTIC CORPORATIONS</p>

<p>A. Any two or more domestic corporations may merge into a single surviving corporation, which may be any one of the constituent corporations or may consolidate into a new resulting corporation formed by the consolidation, pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, as the case may be, complying and approved in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>

<p>B. The board of directors of each corporation which desires to merge or consolidate shall adopt a resolution approving an agreement of merger or consolidation and declaring its advisability. The agreement shall state:</p>

<p>1. The terms and conditions of the merger or consolidation;</p>

<p>2. The mode of carrying the same into effect;</p>

<p>3. In the case of a merger, the amendments or changes in the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation as are desired to be effected by the merger, which amendments or changes may amend and restate the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation in its entirety, or, if no amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of incorporation of the surviving or resulting corporation;</p>

<p>4. In the case of a consolidation, that the certificate of incorporation of the resulting corporation shall be as is set forth in an attachment to the agreement;</p>

<p>5. The manner, if any, of converting the shares of each of the constituent corporations into shares or other securities of the corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation, or of canceling some or all of the shares, and, if any shares of any of the constituent corporations are not to remain outstanding, to be converted solely into shares or other securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or to be canceled, the cash, property, rights, or securities of any other corporation or entity which the holders of the shares are to receive in exchange for or upon conversion of the shares and the surrender of any certificates evidencing them, which cash, property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity may be in addition to or in lieu of shares or other securities of the surviving or resulting corporation; and</p>

<p>6. Other details or provisions as are deemed desirable, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a provision for the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance or recognition of fractional shares, rights or other securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or of any other corporation or entity the shares, rights or other securities of which are to be received in the merger or consolidation, or for any other arrangement with respect thereto, consistent with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67042">Section 1036</a> of this title. The agreement so adopted shall be executed and acknowledged in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67013">Section 1007</a> of this title. Any of the terms of the agreement of merger or consolidation may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside of the agreement; provided, that the manner in which these facts shall operate upon the terms of the agreement is clearly and expressly set forth in the agreement of merger or consolidation. The term facts as used in this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, the occurrence of any event including a determination or action by any person or body including the corporation.</p>

<p>C. The agreement required by the provisions of subsection B of this section shall be submitted to the shareholders of each constituent corporation at an annual or special meeting thereof for the purpose of acting on the agreement. Due notice of the time, place, and purpose of the meeting shall be mailed to each holder of stock whether voting or nonvoting, of the corporation at the address which appears on the records of the corporation, at least twenty (20) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall contain a copy of the agreement or a brief summary thereof; provided, however, the notice shall be effective only with respect to mergers or consolidations for which the notice of the shareholders meeting to vote thereon has been mailed after November 1, 1988. At the meeting the agreement shall be considered and a vote taken for its adoption or rejection. If a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be voted for the adoption of the agreement, that fact shall be certified on the agreement by the secretary or the assistant secretary of the corporation; provided, that such certification on the agreement shall not be required if a certificate of merger or consolidation is filed in lieu of filing the agreement. If the agreement shall be so adopted and certified by each constituent corporation, it shall then be filed and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Section 1007 of this title. In lieu of filing an agreement of merger or consolidation required by this section, the surviving or resulting corporation may file a certificate of merger or consolidation executed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1007 of this title and which states:</p>

<p>1. The name and state of incorporation of each of the constituent corporations;</p>

<p>2. That an agreement of merger or consolidation has been approved, adopted, executed and acknowledged by each of the constituent corporations in accordance with the provisions of this section;</p>

<p>3. The name of the surviving or resulting corporation;</p>

<p>4. In the case of a merger, the amendments or changes in the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation, which may be amended and restated, that are desired to be effected by the merger, which amendments or changes may amend and restate the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation in its entirety, or, if no amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of incorporation;</p>

<p>5. In the case of a consolidation, that the certificate of incorporation of the resulting corporation shall be as is set forth in an attachment to the certificate;</p>

<p>6. That the executed agreement of consolidation or merger is on file at the principal place of business of the surviving or resulting corporation, stating the address thereof; and</p>

<p>7. That a copy of the agreement of consolidation or merger will be furnished by the surviving or resulting corporation, on request and without cost, to any shareholder of any constituent corporation. For purposes of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67090">Sections 1084</a> and <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67092">1086</a> of this title, the term shareholder shall be deemed to include member.</p>

<p>D. Any agreement of merger or consolidation may contain a provision that at any time prior to the time that the agreement, or a certificate filed with the Secretary of State in lieu thereof, becomes effective in accordance with Section 1007 of this title, the agreement may be terminated by the board of directors of any constituent corporation notwithstanding approval of the agreement by the shareholders of all or any of the constituent corporations; provided, if the agreement of merger or consolidation is terminated after the filing of the agreement, or a certificate filed with the Secretary of State in lieu thereof, but before the agreement or certificate has become effective, a certificate of termination of merger or consolidation shall be filed in accordance with Section 1007 of this title. Any agreement of merger or consolidation may contain a provision that the boards of directors of the constituent corporations may amend the agreement at any time prior to the time that the agreement, or a certificate filed with the Secretary of State in lieu thereof, becomes effective in accordance with Section 1007 of this title; provided, that an amendment made subsequent to the adoption of the agreement by the shareholders of any constituent corporation shall not:</p>

<p>1. Alter or change the amount or kind of shares, securities, cash, property or rights to be received in exchange for or on conversion of all or any of the shares of any class or series thereof of the constituent corporation;</p>

<p>2. Alter or change any term of the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation to be effected by the merger or consolidation; or</p>

<p>3. Alter or change any of the terms and conditions of the agreement if an alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any class or series thereof of the constituent corporation.</p>

<p>If the agreement of merger or consolidation is amended after the filing of the agreement, or a certificate in lieu thereof, with the Secretary of State, but before the agreement or certificate has become effective, a certificate of amendment of merger or consolidation shall be filed in accordance with Section 1007 of this title.</p>

<p>E. In the case of a merger, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall automatically be amended to the extent, if any, that changes in the certificate of incorporation are set forth in the certificate of merger.</p>

<p>F. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection C of this section, unless required by its certificate of incorporation, no vote of shareholders of a constituent corporation surviving a merger shall be necessary to authorize a merger if:</p>

<p>1. The agreement of merger does not amend in any respect the certificate of incorporation of the constituent corporation;</p>

<p>2. Each share of stock of the constituent corporation outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger is to be an identical outstanding or treasury share of the surviving corporation after the effective date of the merger; and</p>

<p>3. Either no shares of common stock of the surviving corporation and no shares, securities or obligations convertible into such stock are to be issued or delivered under the plan of merger, or the authorized unissued shares or the treasury shares of common stock of the surviving corporation to be issued or delivered under the plan of merger plus those initially issuable upon conversion of any other shares, securities or obligations to be issued or delivered under the plan do not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the shares of common stock of the constituent corporation outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger. No vote of shareholders of a constituent corporation shall be necessary to authorize a merger or consolidation if no shares of the stock of the corporation shall have been issued prior to the adoption by the board of directors of the resolution approving the agreement of merger or consolidation. If an agreement of merger is adopted by the constituent corporation surviving the merger, by action of its board of directors and without any vote of its shareholders pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the secretary or assistant secretary of that corporation shall certify on the agreement that the agreement has been adopted pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and:</p>

<p>a. if it has been adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection, that the conditions specified have been satisfied, or</p>

<p>b. if it has been adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection, that no shares of stock of the corporation were issued prior to the adoption by the board of directors of the resolution approving the agreement of merger or consolidation; provided, that such certification on the agreement shall not be required if a certificate of merger or consolidation is filed in lieu of filing the agreement.</p>

<p>The agreement so adopted and certified shall then be filed and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Section 1007 of this title. Filing shall constitute a representation by the person who executes the certificate that the facts stated in the certificate remain true immediately prior to filing.</p>

<p>G. 1. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection C of this section, unless expressly required by its certificate of incorporation, no vote of shareholders of a constituent corporation shall be necessary to authorize a merger with or into a single direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation if:</p>

<p>a. the constituent corporation and the direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation are the only constituent entities to the merger,</p>

<p>b. each share or fraction of a share of the capital stock of the constituent corporation outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger is converted in the merger into a share or equal fraction of share of capital stock of a holding company having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as the share of stock of the constituent corporation being converted in the merger,</p>

<p>c. the holding company and the constituent corporation are domestic corporations and the direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary that is the other constituent entity to the merger is a domestic corporation or limited liability company,</p>

<p>d. the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the holding company immediately following the effective time of the merger contain provisions identical to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the constituent corporation immediately before the effective time of the merger, other than provisions, if any, regarding the incorporator or incorporators, the corporate name, the registered office and agent, the initial board of directors and the initial subscribers of shares and provisions contained in any amendment to the certificate of incorporation as were necessary to effect a change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation of stock, if a change, exchange, reclassification or cancellation has become effective,</p>

<p>e. as a result of the merger, the constituent corporation or its successor corporation becomes or remains a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company,</p>

<p>f. the directors of the constituent corporation become or remain the directors of the holding company upon the effective time of the merger,</p>

<p>g. the organizational documents of the surviving entity immediately following the effective time of the merger contain provisions requiring that:</p>

<p>(1) any act or transaction by or involving the surviving entity, other than the election or removal of directors or managers, managing members or other members of the governing body of the surviving entity, that if taken by the constituent corporation immediately before the effective time of the merger would require for its adoption under the Oklahoma General Corporation Act or under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the constituent corporation immediately before the effective time of the merger the approval of the shareholders of the constituent corporation, shall, by specific reference to this subsection, require, in addition to approval of the shareholders or members of the surviving entity, the approval of the shareholders of the holding company or any successor by merger, by the same vote as is required by the Oklahoma General Corporation Act and/or under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the constituent corporation immediately before the effective time of the merger; provided, however, that for purposes of this division, managers, managing members or other members of the entity, which would require the approval of the shareholders of the surviving entity if subject to the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, any amendment of the organizational documents of a surviving entity that is not a corporation, which amendment would, if adopted by a corporation subject to the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, be required to be included in the certificate of incorporation of such corporation, shall, by specific reference to this subsection, require, in addition, the approval of the shareholders of the holding company, or any successor by merger, by the same vote as is required by the Oklahoma General Corporation Act and/or by the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the constituent corporation immediately before the effective time of the merger, and</p>

<p>(2) the business and affairs of a surviving entity that is not a corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, board of managers or other governing body consisting of individuals who are subject to the same fiduciary duties applicable to, and who are liable for breach of such duties to the same extent as, directors of a corporation subject to the Oklahoma General Corporation Act</p>

<p>h. the shareholders of the constituent corporation do not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as determined by the board of directors of the constituent corporation.</p>

<p>Neither subparagraph g of paragraph 1 of this subsection nor any provision of a surviving entitys organizational documents required by subparagraph g of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be deemed or construed to require approval of the shareholders of the holding company to elect or remove directors or managers, managing members or other members of the governing body of the surviving entity.</p>

<p>2. As used in this subsection, the term holding company means a corporation which, from its incorporation until consummation of a merger governed by this subsection, was at all times a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation and whose capital stock is issued in a merger.</p>

<p>3. As used in this subsection, the term organizational documents means, when used in reference to a corporation, the certificate of incorporation of the corporation and, when used in reference to a limited liability company, the articles of organization and the operating agreement of the limited liability company.</p>

<p>4. From and after the effective time of a merger adopted by a constituent corporation by action of its board of directors and without any vote of shareholders pursuant to this subsection:</p>

<p>a. to the extent the restriction of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67099">Section 1090.3 </a>of this title applied to the constituent corporation and its shareholders at the effective time of the merger, restrictions shall apply to the holding company and its shareholders immediately after the effective time of the merger as though it were the constituent corporation, and all shareholders of stock of the holding company acquired in the merger shall for purposes of Section 1090.3 of this title be deemed to have been acquired at the time that the shares of stock of the constituent corporation converted in the merger were acquired; provided, that any shareholder who immediately before the effective time of the merger was not an interested shareholder within the meaning of Section 1090.3 of this title shall not solely by reason of the merger become an interested shareholder of the holding company,</p>

<p>b. if the corporate name of the holding company immediately following the effective time of the merger is the same as the corporate name of the constituent corporation immediately before the effective time of the merger, the shares of capital stock of the holding company into which the shares of capital stock of the constituent corporation are converted in the merger shall be represented by the stock certificates that previously represented the shares of capital stock of the constituent corporation, and</p>

<p>c. to the extent a shareholder of the constituent corporation immediately before the merger had standing to institute or maintain derivative litigation on behalf of the constituent corporation, nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or extinguish such standing.</p>

<p>5. If any agreement of merger is adopted by a constituent corporation by action of its board of directors and without any vote of shareholders pursuant to this subsection, the secretary or assistant secretary of the constituent corporation shall certify on the agreement that the agreement has been adopted pursuant to this subsection and that the conditions specified in paragraph 1 of this subsection have been satisfied; provided, that such certification on the agreement shall not be required if a certificate of merger or consolidation is filed in lieu of filing the agreement. The agreement so adopted and certified shall then be filed and become effective in accordance with Section 1007 of this title. Filing shall constitute a representation by the person who executes the agreement that the facts stated in the certificate remain true immediately before the filing.</p>

<p>H. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection C of this section, unless expressly required by its certificate of incorporation, no vote of shareholders of a constituent corporation that has a class or series of stock that is listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than two thousand holders immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger by such constituent corporation shall be necessary to authorize a merger if:</p>

<p>1. The agreement of merger expressly (a) permits or requires such merger to be effected under this subsection and (b) provides that such merger shall be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the offer referred to in paragraph 2 of this subsection if such merger is effected under this subsection;</p>

<p>2. A corporation consummates an offer for all of the outstanding stock of such constituent corporation on the terms provided in such agreement of merger that, absent this subsection, would be entitled to vote on the adoption or rejection of the agreement of merger; provided, however, that such offer may be conditioned on the tender of a minimum number or percentage of shares of the stock of such constituent corporation, or of any class or series thereof, and such offer may exclude any excluded stock; and provided further, that the corporation may consummate separate offers for separate classes or series of the stock of such constituent corporation;</p>

<p>3. Immediately following the consummation of the offer referred to in paragraph 2 of this subsection, the stock irrevocably accepted for purchase or exchange pursuant to such offer and received by the depository prior to expiration of such offer, together with the stock otherwise owned by the consummating corporation or its affiliates and any rollover stock, equals at least such percentage of the shares of stock of such constituent corporation, and of each class or series thereof, that, absent this subsection, would be required to adopt the agreement of merger by this chapter and by the certificate of incorporation of such constituent corporation;</p>

<p>4. The corporation consummating the offer referred to in paragraph 2 of this subsection merges with or into such constituent corporation pursuant to such agreement;</p>

<p>5. Each outstanding share, other than shares of excluded stock, of each class or series of stock of the constituent corporation that is the subject of and not irrevocably accepted for purchase or exchange in the offer referred to in paragraph 2 of this subsection is to be converted in such merger into, or into the right to receive, the same amount and kind of cash, property, rights or securities paid for shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation irrevocably accepted for purchase or exchange in such offer; and</p>

<p>6. As used in this subsection only, the term:</p>
