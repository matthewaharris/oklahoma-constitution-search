<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. No corporation of any sort, whether coming within 
the general scope of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act or not, except as 
provided for in this section, shall own, hold, or take any real estate located 
in this state outside of any incorporated city or town, or any addition 
thereto.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. The provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation 
Act shall not be construed to prohibit the owning, holding or taking of: 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Such real estate as is necessary and proper for 
carrying on the business for which any corporation has been lawfully formed or 
domesticated in this state;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Naked title to real estate by any trust company, 
as trustee, to be held solely as security for indebtedness pursuant to such 
trust or as trustee of an express or testamentary trust for the benefit of 
natural persons;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Any real estate mortgage held by any corporation 
to secure any loan or debt; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Any real estate acquired by any corporation upon 
the foreclosure of any real estate mortgage held by such corporation or acquired 
in the collection of any loan or debt due such corporation, except as provided 
for in subsection C of this section; or</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Any real estate acquired by any corporation for 
lease or sale to any other corporation, if such latter corporation could have 
legally acquired the same in the first instance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. Any real estate located in this state outside of 
any incorporated city or town, or any addition thereto, acquired by any 
corporation by mortgage foreclosure or in collection of debt as provided for in 
paragraph 4 of subsection B of this section, shall be sold and disposed of 
within seven (7) years from such acquisition.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The provisions of subsections A through C of this 
section shall not apply to religious, educational, charitable or scientific 
corporations, owning or holding taxable property.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. 1. Any person who takes or holds any real estate 
for the use or benefit of any corporation with the intent of evading the 
provisions of this section, shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor and punished by a fine of not less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) nor 
more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment in the county jail 
for a term not less than thirty (30) days nor more than six (6) months, or by 
both such fine and imprisonment.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Any corporation that fails or refuses to file a 
statement as required by the provisions of subsection F of this section shall, 
upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine not 
exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. 1. On or before the first day of April of each 
year, every corporation holding any real estate in contravention of the 
provisions of this section shall file in the office of the county clerk of each 
county where such real estate is located, a statement in duplicate containing 
the legal description of each tract, piece, or parcel of real estate so owned or 
acquired, the date of the acquisition of each tract, piece, or parcel, the 
amount of the last preceding assessed valuation thereof and the purpose and 
method of the acquisition thereof. The statement shall be verified by the oath 
of an officer or duly appointed agent of the corporation.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The county clerk shall keep a permanent index and 
record of each statement filed by corporations pursuant to the provisions of 
this subsection in a permanent record book, which shall be in the form 
prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector. One copy of each statement so 
filed shall be retained as a part of the permanent records of the office of the 
county clerk.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Within thirty (30) days after the statement 
provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection is filed, the county clerk shall 
deliver the other duplicate to the district attorney of such county.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. 1. Any corporation owning or holding any real 
estate in violation of the provisions of subsections A through E of this 
section, in addition to other penalties provided for in the Oklahoma General 
Corporation Act, shall be required to pay, for each year, or fraction thereof, 
during which such title or interest is thus unlawfully owned or held, the 
following penalties:</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. For the first year, one percent (1%) of the 
assessed value of such real estate unlawfully owned or held;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. For the second year, two percent (2%) 
thereof;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. For the third year, three percent (3%) 
thereof;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. For the fourth year, four percent (4%) 
thereof;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e. For the fifth year, five percent (5%) 
thereof;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f. For the sixth year, six percent (6%) thereof; 
and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>g. For each year thereafter, six percent (6%) 
thereof.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Provided, however, that no corporation shall be 
subject to more than one penalty, for each calendar year, for each tract, piece 
or parcel of real estate thus held in violation of the provisions of this 
section, but the penalties provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection shall 
be cumulative.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. In determining the penalty under this subsection, 
the assessed value of the real estate fixed for the purpose of levying ad 
valorem taxes, which last shall have become due and payable preceding the date 
of the accrual of such penalty, shall be taken.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The penalties, upon collection, shall be 
immediately paid over to the Commissioners of the Land Office for credit to the 
permanent school fund of this state created pursuant to Section 2 of Article XI 
of the Oklahoma Constitution.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The state shall have a lien against any piece, 
parcel or tract of real estate to secure the payment of all penalties, interest, 
and fees accruing from such unlawful owning or holding of any such real estate; 
provided, that such lien shall not attach thereto, or in any way affect the 
title thereof, until an action to subject such real estate to such lien and a 
foreclosure thereof has been instituted in the district court of the county 
where such real estate is located. Filing of such action shall be notice lis 
pendens and anyone thereafter acquiring any such real estate shall take it 
subject to such lien.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. 1. Whenever the district attorney of any county 
has reason to believe that any real estate located in such county is owned or 
held by a corporation in violation of the provisions of this section, the 
district attorney shall give written notice to such corporation that:</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. it is subject to the penalties provided for in 
this section;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. such penalties must be paid to the district 
attorney within thirty (30) days from the date of such notice; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. there is additionally due and payable to the 
district attorney a collection fee equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the total 
penalties collected as to any tract, piece or parcel of real estate which is 
unlawfully owned or held. If the institution of an action is necessary to 
procure a judgment for the collection of such penalties, the collection fee 
shall be increased to twenty-five percent (25%) of the penalty recovered, and in 
no event less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). Such fee shall be retained by 
the district attorney as remuneration for services rendered in collecting such 
penalties, which shall be in addition to any compensation otherwise provided for 
by law.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. In the event such penalty shall not be paid within 
thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, the district attorney shall 
institute an action in the name of the state in the district court of the county 
where such real estate is located for the recovery of the penalties, together 
with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date 
of such notice, the collection fee provided for in paragraph 1 of this 
subsection, all costs of the action, and for a further judgment establishing and 
foreclosing any lien created pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 5 of 
subsection G of this section, unless the real estate which is alleged to have 
been unlawfully owned or held, is disposed of prior to the commencement of the 
action.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. The petition in such case shall set 
forth:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) a description of the real estate which is alleged 
to have been unlawfully owned or held;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) the names, as defendants, of the corporation and 
all persons alleged to be unlawfully holding the real estate;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) if the establishment and foreclosure of a lien 
upon such real estate is sought in the action, the names as defendants, of all 
persons claiming real estate, including all tenants and persons in actual 
possession thereof; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) the facts and circumstances in consequence of 
which it is alleged that such real estate is owned or held in violation of the 
provisions of this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. The filing of such petition, and all other 
procedures relating thereto, in all respects shall be governed by and subject to 
the same laws as in other civil actions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. If the state recovers a judgment against such 
corporation in such action, the judgment shall include and be entered 
for:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(1) the amount of the penalties for which the 
corporation is found liable pursuant to the provisions of this 
section;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) interest on such penalties at the rate of ten 
percent (10%) per annum from the date such penalties become due and receivable 
pursuant to the written notice provided for in paragraph 1 of this 
subsection;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(3) a collection fee of twenty-five percent (25%) of 
such penalties recovered, which fee shall not be less than One Hundred Dollars 
($100.00);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(4) the entire costs of the action; and</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>(5) if the establishment and foreclosure of a lien 
upon the real estate is prayed for in the petition, a decree establishing such 
lien upon such real estate and an order of foreclosure.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d. Upon the judgment becoming final, an execution 
shall issue for the collection thereof.</FONT></P><B><I>
