<p style="text-align: center;">CLASSES AND SERIES OF STOCK; RIGHTS, ETC.</p>

<p>A.  Every corporation may issue one or more classes of stock or one or more series of stock within any class thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par value and which classes or series may have voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation.  Any of the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any class or series of stock may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside the certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or outside the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation; provided, that the manner in which the facts shall operate upon the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights, and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the class or series of stock is clearly and expressly set forth in the certificate of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the stock adopted by the board of directors.  The power to increase or decrease or otherwise adjust the capital stock as provided for in the Oklahoma General Corporation Act shall apply to all or any such classes of stock.  The term facts, as used in this subsection, includes, but is not limited to, the occurrence of any event, including a determination or action by any person or body, including the corporation.</p>

<p>B.  Any stock of any class or series may be made subject to redemption by the corporation at its option or at the option of the holders of the stock or upon the happening of a specified event; provided, however, immediately following any redemption, the corporation shall have outstanding one or more shares or one or more classes or series of stock, which share, or shares together, shall have full voting powers.  Notwithstanding the limitation stated in the foregoing proviso:</p>

<p>1.  Any stock of a regulated investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as heretofore or hereafter amended, may be made subject to redemption by the corporation at its option or at the option of the holders of the stock.</p>

<p>2.  Any stock of a corporation which directly or indirectly holds a license or franchise from a governmental agency to conduct its business or is a member of a national securities exchange, which license, franchise or membership is conditioned upon some or all of the holders of its stock possessing prescribed qualifications, may be made subject to redemption by the corporation to the extent necessary to prevent the loss of the license, franchise or membership or to reinstate it.  Any stock which may be made redeemable under this section may be redeemed for cash, property or rights including securities of the same or another corporation, at such time or times, price or prices, or rate or rates, and with any adjustments, as shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the stock adopted by the board of directors as provided for in subsection A of this section.</p>

<p>C.  The holders of preferred or special stock of any class or of any series thereof shall be entitled to receive dividends at such rates, conditions and times as shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the stock adopted by the board of directors as provided for in subsection A of this section, payable in preference to, or in relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or classes or of any other series of stock, and cumulative or noncumulative as shall be so stated and expressed.  When dividends upon the preferred and special stocks, if any, to the extent of the preference to which the stocks are entitled, shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, a dividend on the remaining class or classes or series of stock may then be paid out of the remaining assets of the corporation available for dividends as otherwise provided for in the Oklahoma General Corporation Act.</p>

<p>D.  The holders of the preferred or special stock of any class or of any series thereof shall be entitled to the rights upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the corporation as shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the stock adopted by the board of directors as provided for in subsection A of this section.</p>

<p>E.  Any stock of any class or of any series thereof may be made convertible into, or exchangeable for, at the option of either the holder or the corporation or upon the happening of a specified event, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation, at the price or prices or at the rate or rates of exchange, and with adjustments as shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of the stock adopted by the board of directors as provided for in subsection A of this section.</p>

<p>F.  If any corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent the class or series of stock; provided that, except as otherwise provided for in <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67061">Section 1055</a> of this title, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent the class or series of stock, a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each shareholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the preferences or rights.  Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the corporation shall send to the registered owner a notice, in writing or by electronic transmission, containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this section or <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67043">Section 1037</a>, subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67061">Section 1055</a> or subsection A of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67069">Section 1063</a> of this title, or with respect to this section a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each shareholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the preferences or rights.  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated stock and the rights and obligations of the holder of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall be identical.</p>

<p>G.  1.  When any corporation desires to issue any shares of stock of any class or of any series of any class of which the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, shall not have been set forth in the certificate of incorporation or in any amendment thereto but shall be provided for in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or any amendment thereto, a certificate of designations setting forth a copy of the resolution or resolutions and the number of shares of stock of the class or series to which the resolution or resolutions apply shall be executed, acknowledged and filed, and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67013">Section 1007</a> of this title.  Unless otherwise provided in any resolution or resolutions, the number of shares of stock of any series to which the resolution or resolutions apply may be increased, but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class, or decreased, but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding, by a certificate likewise executed, acknowledged and filed setting forth a statement that a specified increase or decrease therein had been authorized and directed by a resolution or resolutions likewise adopted by the board of directors.  In case the number of the shares shall be decreased, the number of shares so specified in the certificate shall resume the status which they had prior to the adoption of the first resolution or resolutions.  Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, if no shares of stock have been issued of a class or series of stock established by a resolution of the board of directors, the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof may be amended by a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors.  A certificate which states that no shares of the class or series have been issued, sets forth a copy of the resolution or resolutions, and, if the designation of the class or series is being changed, indicates the original designation and the new designation, shall be executed, acknowledged and filed, and shall become effective, in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67013">Section 1007</a> of this title.  When no shares of any class or series are outstanding, either because none were issued or because no issued shares of any class or series remain outstanding, a certificate setting forth a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors that none of the authorized shares of the class or series are outstanding, and that none will be issued subject to the certificate of designations previously filed with respect to the class or series, may be executed, acknowledged and filed in accordance with the provisions of <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67013">Section 1007</a> of this title and, when the certificate becomes effective, it shall have the effect of eliminating from the certificate of incorporation all matters set forth in the certificate of designations with respect to the class or series of stock.</p>

<p>2.  When any certificate filed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection becomes effective, it shall have the effect of amending the certificate of incorporation; except that neither the filing of the certificate nor the filing of a restated certificate of incorporation pursuant to <a href="DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=67086">Section 1080</a> of this title shall prohibit the board of directors from subsequently adopting resolutions as authorized by this subsection.</p>
