<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. Any mutual association may 
become a deposit-type association and any mutual association may become a stock 
association by adoption of a resolution by a majority of the votes cast in 
person or by proxy specially executed for that meeting within ninety (90) days 
prior to the meeting at an annual meeting or at any special meeting of its 
members, and by adoption of an appropriate amended certificate of incorporation 
and bylaw provisions consistent with this act, and in the case of conversions 
from mutual to stock form, upon approval of the conversion by the State Banking 
Commissioner, and if applicable, the Director of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision. Copies of the resolution to become a deposit association and/or 
stock association pursuant to this act and of the amended certificate of 
incorporation and bylaw amendments, certified by the secretary or president of 
the association, shall be filed with the Commissioner. Upon approval by the 
Commissioner, the Commissioner shall file a copy of such approved resolution 
with the Secretary of State, and the association shall be qualified to accept 
deposit accounts and issue permanent capital stock in accordance with this act 
from and after the effective date stated in the resolution. In no case of 
conversion of a mutual to a stock association shall any reserves existing at the 
time of such conversion ever inure to the benefit of the permanent capital 
stock, but shall be maintained as reserves in accordance with directions of the 
Commissioner.</FONT>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. At the meeting at which 
conversion to a stock association is voted upon, the members of the mutual 
association shall also vote upon the directors who shall be the directors of the 
stock association after conversion takes effect. The directors shall execute and 
file with the Commissioner an amended certificate of incorporation as provided 
for in Section 381.17 of this title, together with an application for 
conversion, a fee to be set by the Commissioner, and if the association intends 
to be an insured association, a firm commitment for, or evidence of, insurance 
of its deposit accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The 
Commissioner may refuse to approve the application and decline to issue a 
charter and file the amended certificate of incorporation if there is reason to 
believe that the plan of conversion is not fair and equitable to all the members 
and that sufficient provision is not made to protect the interests of the 
depositors of the prospective capital stock association. Upon the approval by 
the Commissioner of the application for conversion and the amended certificate 
of incorporation and the issuance of a charter, the association shall cease to 
be a mutual association. Upon the conversion of a mutual association, the legal 
existence of the association shall not terminate but the stock association shall 
be a continuation of the entity of the mutual association and all property of 
the mutual association, including its rights, titles and interests in and to all 
property of whatever kind, whether real, personal or mixed, and things in 
action, and every right, privilege, interest and asset of every conceivable 
value or benefit then existing or pertaining to it, or which would inure to it, 
immediately by act of law and without any conveyance or transfer and without any 
further act or deed shall remain and vest in the stock association into which 
the mutual association has converted itself. The stock association shall have, 
hold and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the 
same was possessed, held and enjoyed by the mutual association. The stock 
association as of the time and the taking effect of the conversion shall 
continue to have and succeed to all the rights, obligations and relations of the 
mutual association. All pending actions and other judicial proceedings to which 
the mutual association is a party shall not be abated or discontinued by reason 
of the conversion but may be prosecuted to final judgment, order or decree in 
the same manner as if the conversion had not been made and the stock association 
resulting from the conversion may continue the actions in its corporate name. 
Any judgment, order or decree may be rendered for or against it which might have 
been rendered for or against the mutual association theretofore involved in the 
judicial proceedings.</FONT>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2> C. If the association will be 
an insured association, approval by the Commissioner shall be contingent upon 
the converting association either having insurance of its deposit accounts by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or by the association making a bona 
fide application for insurance of deposit accounts, and upon acceptance and approval 
of such application by the corporation.</FONT>                                                              </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. The conversion of a state

consistent with the other provisions of this title. The plan shall provide 
that:</FONT>                                              </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Each deposit account holder

association equal in amount to the withdrawable account of the deposit account 
holder in the mutual association;</FONT>                                   </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A record date for determining 
deposit account holders entitled to purchase stock shall be established which is 
not less than ninety (90) days prior to the date of adoption of the plan of

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Officers, directors and 
employees of the association and their associates shall forego any participation 
in the initial distribution of permanent capital stock to the extent that any 
such person increased the account of such person by more than Twenty Thousand 
Dollars ($20,000.00) during the six (6) months preceding the record date 
established pursuant to this section. The term "associate" of a person shall 
mean parents, spouse, sisters, brothers, children or anyone married to one of 
the foregoing persons, any corporation of which the person is an officer, 
director or owner of more than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding voting 
securities, any trust of which such person is a trustee or substantial 
beneficiary, and any partnership of which such person is a general or limited 
partner;</FONT>                                                                                                                                 </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The amount of stock to which 
a member is entitled shall be determined on the basis of the ratio of deposits 
of such member with the association on the record date to the total deposits of 
the association on the record date, as applied to the initial issuance of 
permanent capital stock. Each deposit account holder as of the record date may 
receive warrants authorizing the purchase of shares of permanent capital stock 
at a price determined by the board of directors of the institution and approved 
by the Commissioner and by the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and 
scrip denoting fractional stock interests of less than one share, provided, 
however, that no deposit account holder shall be entitled to scrip representing 
fractional interests of less than one-fifth share of stock; and</FONT>                                                                                                                                             </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. In connection with a 
conversion, deposit account holders shall have a preemptive right to purchase 
such permanent capital stock for a period of not less than fourteen (14) days 
from the date the offer to sell permanent capital stock is made.</FONT>                                           </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. If the association is an
