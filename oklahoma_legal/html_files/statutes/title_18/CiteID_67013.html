<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT-->
<p align="center"><span><span>EXECUTION, ACKNOWLEDGMENT, FILING AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS; EXCEPTIONS</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A. Whenever any provision of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act requires any instrument to be filed in accordance with the provisions of this section or with the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, the instrument shall be executed as follows:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>1. The certificate of incorporation and any other instrument to be filed before the election of the initial board of directors, if the initial directors were not named in the certificate of incorporation, shall be signed by the incorporator or incorporators, or in case of any other instrument, the incorporator's or incorporators' successors and assigns. If any incorporator is not available, then any other instrument may be signed, with the same effect as if the incorporator had signed it, by any person for whom or on whose behalf the incorporator, in executing the certificate of incorporation, was acting directly or indirectly as employee or agent; provided that the other instrument shall state that the incorporator is not available and the reason therefor, that the incorporator in executing the certificate of incorporation was acting directly or indirectly as employee or agent for or on behalf of the person, and that the person's signature on the instrument is otherwise authorized and not wrongful;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>2. All other instruments shall be signed:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>a. by any authorized officer of the corporation,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>b. if it appears from the instrument that there are no such officers, then by a majority of the directors or by those directors designated by the board,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>c. if it appears from the instrument that there are no such officers or directors, then by the holders of record, or those designated by the holders of record, of a majority of all outstanding shares of stock, or</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>d. by the holders of record of all outstanding shares of stock.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>B. Whenever any provision of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act requires any instrument to be acknowledged, that requirement is satisfied by either:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>1. The formal acknowledgment by the person or one of the persons signing the instrument that it is his or her act and deed or the act and deed of the corporation, as the case may be, and that the facts stated therein are true. The acknowledgment shall be made before a person who is authorized by the law of the place of execution to take acknowledgments of deeds and who shall affix a seal of office, if any, to the instrument; or</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>2. The signature, without more, of the person or persons signing the instrument, in which case the signature or signatures shall constitute the affirmation or acknowledgment of the signatory, under penalty of perjury, that the instrument is his or her act and deed or the act and deed of the corporation, as the case may be, and that the facts stated therein are true.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>C. Whenever any provision of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act requires any instrument to be filed in accordance with the provisions of this section or with the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, the requirement means that:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>1. One signed instrument shall be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>2. All delinquent franchise taxes authorized by law to be collected by the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be tendered to the Oklahoma Tax Commission as prescribed by </span></span><a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=92293"><span><span>Sections 1201</span></span></a><span><span> through </span></span><a href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=92306"><span><span>1214 of Title 68</span></span></a><span><span> of the Oklahoma Statutes;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>3. All fees authorized by law to be collected by the Secretary of State in connection with the filing of the instrument shall be tendered to the Secretary of State; and</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>4. Upon delivery of the instrument, and upon tender of the required taxes and fees, the Secretary of State shall certify that the instrument has been filed in the Secretary of State's office by endorsing upon the signed instrument the word "Filed", and the date of its filing. This endorsement is the "filing date" of the instrument, and is conclusive of the date of its filing in the absence of actual fraud. Upon request, the Secretary of State shall also endorse the hour that the instrument was filed, which endorsement shall be conclusive of the hour of its filing in the absence of actual fraud. The Secretary of State shall thereupon file and index the endorsed instrument.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>D. Any instrument filed in accordance with the provisions of subsection C of this section shall be effective upon its filing date. Any instrument may provide that it is not to become effective until a specified time subsequent to the time it is filed, but that date shall not be later than a time on the ninetieth day after the date of its filing. If any instrument filed in accordance with subsection C of this section provides for a future effective date or time and if the transaction is terminated or its terms are amended to change the future effective date or time prior to the future effective date or time, the instrument shall be terminated or amended by the filing, prior to the future effective date or time set forth in the instrument, of a certificate of termination or amendment of the original instrument, executed in accordance with subsection A of this section, which shall identify the instrument which has been terminated or amended and shall state that the instrument has been terminated or the manner in which it has been amended.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>E. If another section of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act specifically prescribes a manner of executing, acknowledging, or filing a specified instrument or a time when an instrument shall become effective which differs from the corresponding provisions of this section, then the provisions of the other section shall govern.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>F. Whenever any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under any provision of this title has been so filed and is an inaccurate record of the corporate action therein referred to, or was defectively or erroneously executed, sealed, or acknowledged, the instrument may be corrected by filing with the Secretary of State a certificate of correction of the instrument which shall be executed, acknowledged and filed in accordance with the provisions of this section. The certificate of correction shall specify the inaccuracy or defect to be corrected and shall set forth the portion of the instrument in corrected form. The corrected instrument shall be effective as of the date the original instrument was filed, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by the correction and as to those persons the corrected instrument shall be effective from the filing date of the corrected instrument.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>G. If any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to any provision of this title is filed inaccurately or defectively, or is erroneously executed, sealed, or acknowledged, or is otherwise defective in any respect, the Secretary of State shall have no liability to any person for the preclearance for filing, the acceptance for filing, or the filing and indexing of such instrument.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>H. When authorized by the rules of the Secretary of State, any signature on any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under any provision of this title may be a facsimile signature, a conformed signature, or an electronically transmitted signature.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I. 1. If:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>a. (1) together with the actual delivery of an instrument and tender of the required taxes and fees, there is delivered to the Secretary of State a separate affidavit, which in its heading shall be designated as an affidavit of extraordinary condition, attesting, on the basis of personal knowledge of the affiant or a reliable source of knowledge identified in the affidavit, that an earlier effort to deliver the instrument and tender taxes and fees was made in good faith, specifying the nature, date and time of the good faith effort and requesting that the Secretary of State establish the date and time as the filing date of the instrument, or</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>(2) upon the actual delivery of an instrument and tender of the required taxes and fees, the Secretary of State in his or her discretion provides a written waiver of the requirement for an affidavit stating that it appears to the Secretary of State that an earlier effort to deliver the instrument and tender the taxes and fees was made in good faith and specifying the date and time of the effort, and</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>b. the Secretary of State determines that an extraordinary condition existed at that date and time, that the earlier effort was unsuccessful as a result of the existence of an extraordinary condition, and that the actual delivery and tender were made within a reasonable period, not to exceed two (2) business days, after the cessation of the extraordinary condition,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>then the Secretary of State may establish the date and time as the filing date of the instrument. No fee shall be paid to the Secretary of State for receiving an affidavit of extraordinary condition.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>2. For purposes of this subsection, an extraordinary condition means: any emergency resulting from an attack on, invasion or occupation by foreign military forces of, or disaster, catastrophe, war or other armed conflict, revolution or insurrection, or rioting or civil commotion in, the United States or a locality in which the Secretary of State conducts its business or in which the good faith effort to deliver the instrument and tender the required taxes and fees is made, or the immediate threat of any of the foregoing; or any malfunction or outage of the electrical or telephone service to the Secretary of State's office, or weather or other condition in or about a locality in which the Secretary of State conducts its business, as a result of which the Secretary of State's office is not open for the purpose of the filing of instruments under the Oklahoma General Corporation Act or the filing cannot be effected without extraordinary effort. The Secretary of State may require such proof as it deems necessary to make the determination required under subparagraph b of paragraph 1 of this subsection, and any determination shall be conclusive in the absence of actual fraud.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>3. If the Secretary of State establishes the filing date of an instrument pursuant to this subsection, the date and time of delivery of the affidavit of extraordinary condition or the date and time of the Secretary of State's written waiver of the affidavit shall be endorsed on the affidavit or waiver and the affidavit or waiver, so endorsed, shall be attached to the filed instrument to which it relates. The filed instrument shall be effective as of the date and time established as the filing date by the Secretary of State pursuant to this subsection, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by the establishment and, as to those persons, the instrument shall be effective from the date and time endorsed on the affidavit of extraordinary condition or written waiver attached thereto.</span></span></p>
