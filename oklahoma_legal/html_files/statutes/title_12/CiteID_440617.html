<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>POSTJUDGMENT INTEREST<BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A. 1. Except as otherwise provided by this section, 
all judgments of courts of record, including costs and attorney fees authorized 
by statute or otherwise and allowed by the court, shall bear interest at a rate 
prescribed pursuant to this section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Costs and attorney fees allowed by the court shall 
bear interest from the earlier of the date the judgment or order is pronounced, 
if expressly stated in the written judgment or order awarding the costs and 
attorney fees, or the date the judgment or order is filed with the court 
clerk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>B. Judgments, including costs and attorney fees 
authorized by statute or otherwise and allowed by the court, against this state 
or its political subdivisions, including counties, municipalities, school 
districts, and public trusts of which this state or a political subdivision of 
this state is a beneficiary, shall bear interest during the term of judgment at 
a rate prescribed pursuant to this section, but not to exceed ten percent (10%), 
from the date of rendition. No judgment against this state or its political 
subdivisions, including counties, municipalities, school districts, and public 
trusts of which this state or a political subdivision of this state is a 
beneficiary, inclusive of postjudgment interest, shall exceed the total amount 
of liability of the governmental entity pursuant to the Governmental Tort Claims 
Act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>C. The postjudgment interest authorized by subsection 
A or subsection B of this section shall accrue from the earlier of the date the 
judgment is rendered as expressly stated in the judgment, or the date the 
judgment is filed with the court clerk, and shall initially accrue at the rate 
in effect for the calendar year during which the judgment is rendered until the 
end of the calendar year in which the judgment was rendered, or until the 
judgment is paid, whichever first occurs. Beginning on the first day of January 
of the next succeeding calendar year until the end of that calendar year, or 
until the judgment is paid, whichever first occurs, the judgment, together with 
postjudgment interest previously accrued, shall bear interest at the rate in 
effect for judgments rendered during that calendar year as certified by the 
Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant to subsection I of this section. 
For each succeeding calendar year, or part of a calendar year, during which a 
judgment remains unpaid, the judgment, together with postjudgment interest 
previously accrued, shall bear interest at the rate in effect for judgments 
rendered during that calendar year as certified by the Administrative Director 
of the Courts pursuant to subsection I of this section. A separate computation 
using the interest rate in effect for judgments as provided by subsection I of 
this section shall be made for each calendar year, or part of a calendar year, 
during which the judgment remains unpaid in order to determine the total amount 
of interest for which the judgment debtor is liable. The postjudgment interest 
rate for each calendar year or part of a calendar year a judgment remains unpaid 
shall be multiplied by the original amount of the judgment, including any 
prejudgment interest, together with postjudgment interest previously accrued. 
Interest shall accrue on a judgment in the manner prescribed by this subsection 
until the judgment is satisfied or released.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>D. If a rate of interest is specified in a contract, 
the rate specified shall apply and be stated in the journal entry of judgment. 
The rate of interest shall not exceed the lawful rate for that obligation. 
Postjudgment interest shall be calculated and accrued in the same manner as 
prescribed in subsection C of this section.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>PREJUDGMENT INTEREST<BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>E. Except as provided by subsection F of this 
section, if a verdict for damages by reason of personal injuries or injury to 
personal rights including, but not limited to, injury resulting from bodily 
restraint, personal insult, defamation, invasion of privacy, injury to personal 
relations, or detriment due to an act or omission of another is accepted by the 
trial court, the court in rendering judgment shall add interest on the verdict 
at a rate prescribed pursuant to subsection I of this section from the date the 
suit resulting in the judgment was commenced to the earlier of the date the 
verdict is accepted by the trial court as expressly stated in the judgment, or 
the date the judgment is filed with the court clerk. The interest rate for 
computation of prejudgment interest shall begin with the rate prescribed by 
subsection I of this section which is in effect for the calendar year in which 
the suit resulting in the judgment is commenced. This rate shall be in effect 
until the end of the calendar year in which the suit resulting in judgment was 
filed or until the date judgment is filed, whichever first occurs. Beginning on 
the first day of January of the next succeeding calendar year until the end of 
that calendar year, or until the date the judgment is filed, whichever first 
occurs, and for each succeeding calendar year thereafter, the prejudgment 
interest rate shall be the rate in effect for judgments rendered during each 
calendar year as certified by the Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant 
to subsection I of this section. After the computation of all prejudgment 
interest has been completed, the total amount of prejudgment interest shall be 
added to the amount of the judgment rendered pursuant to the trial of the 
action, and the total amount of the resulting judgment shall become the amount 
upon which postjudgment interest is computed pursuant to subsection A of this 
section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>F. If a verdict of the type described by subsection E 
of this section is rendered against this state or its political subdivisions, 
including counties, municipalities, school districts, and public trusts of which 
this state or a political subdivision of this state is a beneficiary, the 
judgment shall bear interest at the rate prescribed pursuant to subsection I of 
this section, but not to exceed ten percent (10%) from the date the suit was 
commenced to the earlier of the date the verdict is accepted by the trial court 
as expressly stated in the judgment or the date the judgment is filed with the 
court clerk. The interest rate for computation of prejudgment interest shall 
begin with the rate prescribed by subsection I of this section which is in 
effect for the calendar year in which the suit resulting in the judgment is 
commenced. This rate shall be in effect until the end of the calendar year in 
which the suit resulting in judgment was filed or until the date the judgment is 
rendered as expressly stated in the judgment, whichever first occurs. Beginning 
on the first day of January of the next succeeding calendar year until the end 
of that calendar year, or until the date judgment is rendered, whichever first 
occurs, and for each succeeding calendar year thereafter, the prejudgment 
interest rate shall be the rate in effect for judgments rendered during each 
calendar year as certified by the Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant 
to subsection I of this section. After the computation of prejudgment interest 
has been completed, the amount shall be added to the amount of the judgment 
rendered pursuant to the trial of the action, and the total amount of the 
resulting judgment shall become the amount upon which postjudgment interest is 
computed pursuant to subsection B of this section. No award of prejudgment 
interest against this state or its political subdivisions, including counties, 
municipalities, school districts, and public trusts of which this state or a 
political subdivision of this state is a beneficiary, including the amount of 
the judgment awarded pursuant to trial of the action, shall exceed the total 
amount of liability of the governmental entity pursuant to the Governmental Tort 
Claims Act.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>G. If exemplary or punitive damages are awarded in an 
action for personal injury or injury to personal rights including, but not 
limited to, injury resulting from bodily restraint, personal insult, defamation, 
invasion of privacy, injury to personal relations, or detriment due to an act or 
omission of another, the interest on that award shall begin to accrue from the 
earlier of the date the judgment is rendered as expressly stated in the 
judgment, or the date the judgment is filed with the court clerk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>H. If a judgment is rendered establishing the 
existence of a lien against property and no rate of interest exists, the court 
shall allow prejudgment interest at a rate prescribed pursuant to subsection I 
of this section from the date the lien is filed to the date of 
verdict.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I. For purposes of computing either postjudgment 
interest or prejudgment interest as authorized by this section, interest shall 
be determined using a rate equal to the average United States Treasury Bill rate 
of the preceding calendar year as certified to the Administrative Director of 
the Courts by the State Treasurer on the first regular business day in January 
of each year, plus four percentage points.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>J. For purposes of computing postjudgment interest, 
the provisions of this section, including the amendments prescribed by Chapter 
320, O.S.L. 1997, shall be applicable to all judgments of the district courts 
rendered on or after January 1, 2000 but before January 1, 2005. Until January 
1, 2005, the method for computing postjudgment interest prescribed by this 
section shall be applicable to all judgments remaining unpaid rendered prior to 
January 1, 2000.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>K. For purposes of computing prejudgment interest, 
the provisions of this section, including the amendments prescribed by Chapter 
320, O.S.L. 1997, shall be applicable to all actions which are filed in the 
district courts on or after January 1, 2000, but before January 1, 2005, for 
which an award of prejudgment interest is authorized by the provisions of this
