<!--BEGIN DOCUMENT--><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><FONT size=2><FONT 
size=2>
<P>A. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, a party may obtain a 
stay of the enforcement of a judgment, decree or final order:</P>
<P>1. While a posttrial motion is pending;</P>
<P>2. During the time in which an appeal may be commenced in any court in or 
outside of this state; or</P>
<P>3. While an appeal is pending in any court in or outside of this state.</P>
<P>Such stay may be obtained by filing with the court clerk a written 
undertaking and the posting of a supersedeas bond or other security as provided 
in this section. In the undertaking the appellant shall agree to satisfy the 
judgment, decree or final order, and pay the costs and interest on appeal, if it 
is affirmed. The undertaking and supersedeas bond or security may be given at 
any time. The stay is effective when the bond and the sufficiency of the 
sureties are approved by the trial court or the security is deposited with the 
court clerk. The enforcement of the judgment, decree or order shall no longer be 
stayed, and the judgment, decree or order may be enforced against any surety on 
the bond or other security:</P>
<P>1. If neither a posttrial motion nor a petition in error is filed, and the 
time for appeal has expired;</P>
<P>2. If a posttrial motion is no longer pending, no petition in error has been 
filed, and the time for appeal has expired; or</P>
<P>3. If an appeal is no longer pending.</P>
<P>B. The amount of the bond or other security shall be as follows:</P>
<P>1. When the judgment, decree or final order is for payment of money:</P>
<P>a. Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided, the bond shall be double 
the amount of the judgment, decree or final order, unless the bond is executed 
or guaranteed by a surety as hereinafter provided. The bond shall be for the 
amount of the judgment, decree or order including costs and interest on appeal 
where it is executed or guaranteed by an entity with suretyship powers as 
provided by the laws of Oklahoma.</P>
<P>b. Upon a showing by the judgment debtor that the judgment debtor is likely 
to suffer substantial economic harm if required to post bond in the amount 
required by this paragraph, the court shall balance the likely substantial 
economic harm to the judgment debtor with the ability of the judgment creditor 
to collect the judgment in the event the judgment is affirmed on appeal and may 
lower the bond accordingly. "Substantial economic harm" means insolvency or 
creating a significant risk of insolvency. The court shall not lower a bond as 
provided in this paragraph to the extent there is in effect an insurance policy, 
or agreement under which a third party is liable to satisfy part or all of the 
judgment entered and such party is required to post all or part of the bond.</P>
<P>c. Subject to the limitations contained in this paragraph, the bond shall not 
exceed Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00).</P>
<P>d. Upon limiting the bond pursuant to subparagraphs b or c of this paragraph, 
the court shall enter an order enjoining a judgment debtor from dissipating or 
transferring assets to avoid satisfaction of the judgment, but the court shall 
not make any order that interferes with the judgment debtors use of assets in 
the normal course of business. If it is proven by a preponderance of the 
evidence that the appellant for whom the bond would be or has been limited 
pursuant to subparagraph b or c of this paragraph likely will be or is 
intentionally dissipating or diverting assets or engaging in other conduct 
outside of the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of avoiding 
payment of the judgment, the court shall enter such orders as are necessary to 
prevent such conduct including, but not limited to, requiring that a bond be 
posted equal to the full amount of security required pursuant to this section, 
without the reduction or limitations allowed by subparagraph b or c of this 
paragraph.</P>
<P>e. Instead of filing a supersedeas bond, the appellant may obtain a stay by 
depositing cash with the court clerk in the amount of the judgment or order plus 
an amount that the court determines will cover costs and interest on appeal. The 
court shall have discretion to accept United States Treasury notes or general 
obligation bonds of the State of Oklahoma in lieu of cash. If the court accepts 
such notes or bonds, it shall make appropriate orders for their safekeeping and 
maintenance during the stay;</P>
<P>2. When the judgment, decree or final order directs execution of a conveyance 
or other instrument, the amount of the bond shall be determined by the court. 
Instead of posting a supersedeas bond or other security, the appellant may 
execute the conveyance or other instrument and deliver it to the clerk of the 
court for deposit with a public or private entity for safekeeping, as directed 
by the court in writing;</P>
<P>3. When the judgment, decree or final order directs the delivery of 
possession of real or personal property, the bond shall be in an amount, to be 
determined by the court, that will protect the interests of the parties. The 
court may consider the value of the use of the property, any waste that may be 
committed on or to the property during the pendency of the stay, the value of 
the property, and all costs. When the judgment, decree or final order is for the 
sale of mortgaged premises and the payment of a deficiency arising from the 
sale, the bond must also provide for the payment of the deficiency;</P>
<P>4. When the judgment or final order directs the assignment or delivery of 
documents, they may be placed in the custody of the clerk of the court in which 
the judgment or order was rendered, for deposit with a public or private entity 
for safekeeping during the pendency of the stay, as directed by the court in 
writing, or the bond shall be in such sum as may be prescribed by the court; 
</P>
<P>5. The bond in any action or litigation brought under any legal theory 
involving a nonparticipating manufacturer to the Master Settlement Agreement 
dated November 23, 1998, shall be in an amount not to exceed one hundred percent 
(100%) of the judgment, exclusive of interest and costs, ten percent (10%) of 
the net worth of the judgment debtor, or Twenty-five Million Dollars 
($25,000,000.00), whichever is less. Provided, however, these bond limitations 
shall not apply to judgments in favor of the State of Oklahoma, its agencies or 
officers; or</P>
<P>6. In order to protect any monies payable to the Tobacco Settlement Fund as 
set forth in <A href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=104729">Section 50</A> of Title 
62 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the bond in any action or litigation brought under 
any legal theory involving a signatory, successor of a signatory or an affiliate 
of a signatory to the Master Settlement Agreement dated November 23, 1998, or a 
signatory, successor of a signatory or an affiliate of a signatory to the 
Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, also dated November 23, 1998, 
shall be in an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the judgment, 
exclusive of interest and costs, ten percent (10%) of the net worth of the 
judgment debtor, or Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00), whichever is 
less. However, if it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
appellant for whom the bond has been limited pursuant to this paragraph is 
intentionally dissipating or diverting assets outside of the ordinary course of 
its business for the purpose of avoiding payment of the judgment, the court 
shall enter such orders as are necessary to prevent dissipation or diversion, 
including, but not limited to, requiring that a bond be posted equal to the full 
amount of security required pursuant to this section. For purposes of this 
paragraph, "Master Settlement Agreement" shall have the same meaning as that 
term is defined in paragraph 5 of <A 
href="DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=104398">Section 600.22</A> of Title 37 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes, and "Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement" means the 
settlement agreement and related documents entered into on November 23, 1998, by 
this state and leading United States smokeless tobacco product 
manufacturers.</P>
<P>C. Subsections A and B of this section shall not apply in actions involving 
temporary or permanent injunctions, actions for divorce, separate maintenance, 
annulment, paternity, custody, adoption, or termination of parental rights, or 
in juvenile matters, postdecree matrimonial proceedings or habeas corpus 
proceedings. The trial or appellate court, in its discretion, may stay the 
enforcement of any provision in a judgment, decree or final order in any of the 
types of actions or proceedings listed in this subsection during the pendency of 
the appeal or while any posttrial motion is pending upon such terms as to bond 
or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the 
parties. If a temporary or permanent injunction is denied or dissolved, the 
trial or appellate court, in its discretion, may restore or grant an injunction 
during the pendency of the appeal and while any posttrial motions are pending 
upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security 
of the rights of the parties.</P>
<P>D. In any action not provided for in subsection A, B or C of this section, 
the court may stay the enforcement of any judgment, decree or final order during 
the pendency of the appeal or while any posttrial motion is pending upon such 
terms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the 
rights of the parties.</P>
<P>E. The trial court shall have continuing jurisdiction during the pendency of 
any posttrial motion and appeal to modify any order it has entered regarding 
security or other conditions in connection with a stay.</P>
<P>F. The execution of a supersedeas bond shall not be a condition for the 
granting of a stay of judgment, decree or final order of any judicial tribunal 
against any county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the State of 
Oklahoma.</P>
<P>G. Executors, administrators and guardians who have given bond in this state, 
with sureties, according to law, are not required to provide a supersedeas bond 
if they are granted a stay of enforcement of a judgment, decree or final 
order.</P>
<P>H. After an appeal has been decided, but before the mandate has issued, a 
party whose trial court judgment has been affirmed, may move the appellate court 
to order judgment on the bond or other security in the amount of the judgment 
plus interest, appeals costs and allowable appeal-related attorney fees. After 
mandate has issued, a party who has posted a bond or other security may move for 
exoneration of the bond or other security only in the trial court; and all 
motions concerning the bond or other security must be addressed to the trial 
court.</P>
<P>I. For judgments entered after November 1, 2009, appeal bonds shall not be 
required for appeals of punitive damages.</P></FONT></FONT></SPAN><SPAN
